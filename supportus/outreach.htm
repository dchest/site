<br/>We recently received a donation of books, among which were a quantity of LaBoetie’s THE POLITICS OF OBEDIENCE. We would like you to gift these, and possibly other titles, and/or back issues of THE VOLUNTARYIST to individuals who you think might benefit from reading them.
<br/><br/>
This could include people of influence, or people in the public eye, who you think might be sympathetic to the voluntaryist message.
<br/><br/>
It also might include up-and-coming students of voluntaryism who might be encouraged by the receipt of such a book or a newsletter.
<br/><br/>
Consequently, we are soliciting suggestions on how to use these books.
<br/><br/>
Do you know of a libertarian book club that might make use of them?
<br/><br/>
Do you have a particular back issue of THE VOLUNTARYIST that you would like sent to a special person?
<br/><br/>
Please send names and addresses and a short explanation of why you are recommending that this person be a recipient to <?php echo email('outreach','','the editor'); ?>.
<br/><br/>
And, please let us know if you have books, new or used, that you would like to be included in this program by listing them in the comments section below.
