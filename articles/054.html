 <h2>Persuasion versus Force</h2>
 <h4>by <a href="#author">Mark Skousen</a><br>
  From Number 54 - February 1992</h4>
</center>
<p>This essay originally from the September, 1991, issue of <a HREF="http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/">Liberty</a>
 magazine. see Editor's <a HREF="#note">note</a></p>
<p>Sometimes a single book or even a short cogent essay can change an individual's
 entire outlook on life. For Christians, it is the New Testament. For radical
 socialists, Karl Marx' and Friedrich Engels' <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>
 is revolutionary. For libertarians, Ayn Rand's <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> is pivotal.
 For economists, Ludwig von Mises' <em>Human Action</em> can be mind-changing.</p>
<p>Recently I came across a little essay in a book called <em>Adventures of Ideas</em>,
 by Alfred North Whitehead, the British philosopher and Harvard professor. The
 essay, &quot;From Force to Persuasion,&quot; had a profound effect upon me. Actually
 what caught my attention was a single passage on page 83. This one small excerpt
 in a 300-page book changed my entire political philosophy.</p>
<p>Here's what it says:</p>
<p>&quot;The creation of the world - said Plato - is the victory of persuasion
 over force... Civilization is the maintenance of social order, by its own inherent
 persuasiveness as embodying the nobler alternative. The recourse to force, however
 unavoidable, is a disclosure of the failure of civilization, either in the general
 society or in a remnant of individuals...</p>
<p>&quot;Now the intercourse between individuals and between social groups takes
 one of these two forms: force or persuasion. Commerce is the great example of
 intercourse by way of persuasion. War, slavery, and governmental compulsion exemplify
 the reign of force.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Whitehead's vision of civilized society as the triumph of persuasion
 over force should become paramount in the mind of all civic-minded individuals
 and government leaders. It should serve as the guideline for the political ideal.</p>
<p>Let me suggest, therefore, a new political creed:<br>
 <strong>The triumph of persuasion over force is the sign of a civilized society.</strong></p>
<p>Surely this is a fundamental principle to which most citizens, no matter where
 they fit on the political spectrum, can agree.</p>
<h4>Too Many Laws</h4>
<p>Too often lawmakers resort to the force of law rather than the power of persuasion
 to solve a problem in society. They are too quick to pass another statute or
 regulation in an effort to suppress the effects of a deeprooted problem in society
 rather than seeking to recognize and deal with the real cause of the problem,
 which may require parents, teachers, pastors, and community leaders to convince
 people to change their ways.</p>
<p>Too often politicians think that new programs requiring new taxes are the only
 way to pay for citizens' retirement, health care, education or other social needs.
 &quot;People just aren't willing to pay for these services themselves,&quot;
 they say, so they force others to pay for them instead.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, &quot;Taxation is the
 price we pay for civilization.&quot; But isn't the opposite really the case?
 Taxation is the price we pay for failing to build a civilized society. The higher
 the tax level, the greater the failure. A centrally planned totalitarian state
 represents a complete defeat for the civilized world, while a totally voluntary
 society represents its ultimate success.</p>
<p>Thus, legislators, ostensibly concerned about poverty and low wages, pass a
 minimum wage law and establish a welfare state as their way to abolish poverty.
 Yet poverty persists, not for want of money, but for want of skills, capital,
 education, and the desire to succeed.</p>
<p>The community demands a complete education for all children, so the state mandates
 that all children attend school for at least ten years. Winter Park High School,
 which two of our children attend, is completely fenced in. Students need a written
 excuse to leave school grounds and an official explanation for absences. All
 the gates except one are closed during school hours, and there is a permanent
 guard placed at the only open gate to monitor students coming and going. Florida
 recently passed a law that takes away the driver's license of any student who
 drops out of high school. Surely, they say, that will eliminate the high dropout
 rate for students.</p>
<p>But suppressing one problem only creates another. Now students who don't want
 to be in school are disrupting the students who want to learn. The lawmakers
 forget one thing. Schooling is not the same as education.</p>
<p>Many high-minded citizens don't like to see racial, religious or sexual discrimination
 in employment, housing, department stores, restaurants, and clubs. Yet instead
 of persuading people in the schools, the churches and the media that discrimination
 is inappropriate behavior and morally repugnant, law-makers simply pass civil
 rights legislation outlawing discrimination, as though making hatred illegal
 can instantly make it go away. Instead, forced integration often intensifies
 the already-existing hostilities. Does anyone wonder why discrimination is still
 a serious problem in our society?</p>
<p>Is competition from the Japanese, the Germans and the Brazilians too stiff
 for American industry? We can solve that right away, says Congress. No use trying
 to convince industry to invest in more productive labor and capital, or voting
 to reduce the tax burden on business. No, they'll just impose import quotas or
 heavy duties on foreign products and force them to &quot;play fair.&quot; Surely
 that will make us more competitive, and keep American companies in business.</p>
<h4>Drugs, Guns, and Abortion</h4>
<p>Is the use of mind-altering drugs a problem in America? Then let's pass legislation
 prohibiting the use of certain high-powered drugs. People still want to use them?
 Then let's hire more police to crack down on the drug users and drug dealers.
 Surely that will solve the problem. Yet such laws never address the fundamental
 issue, which would require analyzing why people misuse drugs and discovering
 ways they can satisfy their needs in a nondestructive manner. By out-lawing illicit
 drugs, we fail to consider the underlying cause of increased drug or alcohol
 misuse among teenagers and adults, and we fail to accept the beneficial uses
 of such drugs in medicine and healthcare. I salute voluntary efforts in communities
 to deal with these serious problems, such as &quot;no alcohol&quot; high school
 graduation parties and drug-awareness classes. Tobacco is on the decline as a
 result of education, and drug use could abate as well if it were treated as a
 medical problem rather than a criminal one.</p>
<p>Abortion is a troublesome issue, we all agree on that. Whose rights take precedence,
 the baby's or the mother's? When does life begin, at conception or at birth?</p>
<p>Political conservatives are shocked by the millions of legal killings that
 take place every year in America and around the world. How can we sing &quot;God
 Bless America&quot; with this epidemic plaguing our nation? So, for many conservatives
 the answer is simple: Ban abortions! Force women to give birth to their unexpected
 and unwanted babies. That will solve the problem. This quick fix will undoubtedly
 give the appearance that we have instantly solved our national penchant for genocide.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better if we first tried to answer the all important questions,
 &quot;Why is abortion so prevalent today, and how can we prevent unwanted pregnancies?&quot;
 Or, once an unwanted pregnancy occurs, how can we persuade people to examine
 alternatives, including adoption?</p>
<p>Crime is another issue plaguing this country. There are those in society who
 want to ban handguns, rifles and other firearms, or at least have them tightly
 controlled and registered, in an attempt to reduce crime. We can solve the murder
 and crime problem in this country, they reason, simply by passing a law taking
 away the weapons of murder. No guns, no killings. Simple, right? Yet they only
 change the outward symptoms, while showing little interest in finding ways to
 discourage a person from becoming criminal or violent in the first place.</p>
<p>Legislators should be slow to pass laws to protect people against themselves.
 While insisting on a woman's &quot;right to choose&quot; in one area, they deny
 men and women the right to choose in every other area. Unfortunately, they are
 all too quick to act. Drivers aren't wearing their seatbelts? Let's pass a mandatory
 seatbelt law. Motorcyclists aren't wearing helmets? Let's mandate helmets. We'll
 force people to be responsible!</p>
<h4>More Than Just Freedom</h4>
<p>How did we get into this situation, where lawmakers feel compelled to legislate
 personal behavior &quot;for our own good&quot;? Often we only have ourselves
 to blame.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear: If we are going to preserve what personal and economic
 freedom we have left in this country, we had better act responsibly, or our freedom
 is going to be taken away. Too many detractors think that freedom is nothing
 more than the right to act irresponsibly. They equate liberty with libertine
 behavior: that the freedom to choose whether to have an abortion means that they
 should have an abortion, that the freedom to take drugs means that they should
 take drugs, that the legalization of gambling means that they should play the
 roulette wheel.</p>
<p>It is significant that Professor Whitehead chose the word &quot;persuasion,&quot;
 not simply &quot;freedom,&quot; as the ideal characteristic of the civilized
 world. The word &quot;persuasion&quot; embodies both freedom of choice and responsibility
 for choice. In order to persuade, you must have a moral philosophy, a system
 of right and wrong, which you govern yourself. You want to persuade people to
 do the right thing not because they have to, but because they want to.</p>
<p>There is little satisfaction from doing good if individuals are mandated to
 do the right thing. Character and responsibility are built when people voluntarily
 choose right over wrong, not when they are forced to do so. A soldier will feel
 a greater sense of victory if he enlists in the armed forces instead of being
 drafted. And high school students will not comprehend the joy of service if it
 is mandated by a community-service requirement for graduation.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there will be individuals in a free society who will make the wrong
 choices, who will become drug addicts and alcoholics, who will refuse to wear
 a safety helmet, who will hurt themselves playing with firecrackers, and who
 will drop out of high school. But that is the price we must pay for having a
 free society, where individuals learn from their mistakes and try to build a
 better world.</p>
<p>In this context, let us answer the all-important question, &quot;Liberty and
 morality: can we have both?&quot; The answer is, absolutely yes! Not only can
 we have both, but we must have both, or eventually we will have neither. As Sir
 James Russell Lowell said, &quot;The ultimate result of protecting fools from
 their folly is to fill the planet full of fools.&quot;</p>
<p>Our motto should be, &quot;We teach them correct principles, and they govern
 themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Freedom without responsibility only leads to the destruction of civilization,
 as evidenced by Rome and other great civilizations of the past. As Alexis de
 Tocqueville said, &quot;Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot.&quot;
 In a similar vein, Henry Ward Beecher added, &quot;There is no liberty to men
 who know not how to govern themselves.&quot; And Edmund Burke wrote, &quot;What
 is liberty without wisdom and without virtue?&quot;</p>
<p>Today's political leaders demonstrate their low opinion of the public with
 every social law they pass. They believe that, if given the right to choose,
 the citizenry will probably make the wrong choice. Legislators do not think any
 more in terms of persuading people; they feel the need to force their agenda
 on the public at the point of a bayonet and the barrel of a gun, in the name
 of the IRS, the SEC, the FDA, the DEA, the EPA, or a multitude of other ABCs
 of government authority.</p>
<h4>A Challenge to All Lovers of Liberty</h4>
<p>My challenge to all lovers of liberty today is to take the moral high ground.
 Our cause is much more compelling when we can say that we support drug legalization,
 but do not use mind altering drugs. That we tolerate legal abortion, but choose
 not to abort our own future generations. That we support the right to bear arms,
 but do not misuse handguns. That we favor the right of individuals to meet privately
 as they please, but do not ourselves discriminate.</p>
<p>In the true spirit of liberty, Voltaire once said, &quot;I disapprove of what
 you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.&quot; If we are
 to be effective in convincing others of the benefits of a tolerant world, we
 must take the moral high ground by saying, &quot;We may disapprove of what you
 do, but we will defend to the death your right to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>In short, my vision of a responsible free society is one in which we discourage
 evil, but do not prohibit it. We make our children and students aware of the
 consequences of drug abuse and other forms of irresponsible behavior. But after
 all our persuading, if they still want to use harmful drugs, that is their privilege.
 In a free society, individuals must have the right to do right or wrong, as long
 as they don't threaten or infringe upon the rights or property of others. They
 must also suffer the consequences of their actions, as it is from consequences
 that they learn to choose properly.</p>
<p>We may discourage prostitution or pornography by restricting it to certain
 areas and to certain ages, but we will not jail or fine those who choose to participate
 in it privately. If an adult bookstore opens in our neighborhood, we don't run
 to the law and pass an ordinance, we picket the store and discourage customers.
 If our religion asks us not to shop on Sunday, we don't pass Sunday &quot;blue&quot;
 laws forcing stores to close, we simply don't patronize them on Sunday. If we
 don't like excessive violence and gratuitous sex on TV, we don't write the Federal
 Communications Commission, we join boycotts of the advertiser's products. Several
 years ago the owners of Seven Eleven stores removed pornographic magazines from
 their stores, not because the law required it, but because a group of concerned
 citizens persuaded them. These actions reflect the true spirit of liberty.</p>
<p>Lovers of liberty should also be strong supporters of the institutions of persuasion,
 such as churches, charities, foundations, private schools and colleges, and private
 enterprise. They should engage in many causes of their own free will and choice.
 They should not rely on the institutions of force, such as government agencies,
 to carry out the cause of education and the works of charity and welfare. It
 is not enough simply to pay your taxes and cast your vote and think you've done
 your part.</p>
<p>It is the duty of every advocate of human liberty to convince the world that
 we must solve our problems through persuasion and not coercion. Whether the issue
 is domestic policy or foreign policy, we must recognize that passing another
 regulation or going to war is not necessarily the only solution to our problems.
 Simply to pass laws prohibiting the outward symptoms of problems is to sweep
 the real problems under the rug. It may hide the dirt for a while, but it doesn't
 dispose of the dirt properly or permanently.</p>
<h4>Liberty Under Law</h4>
<p>This approach does not mean that laws would not exist. People should have the
 freedom to act according to their desires, but only to the extent that they do
 not trample on the rights of others. Rules and regulations, such as traffic laws,
 need to be established and enforced by private and public institutions in order
 for a free society to exist. There should be stringent laws against fraud, theft,
 murder, pollution, and the breaking of contracts, and those laws should be effectively
 enforced according to the classic principle that the punishment should fit the
 crime. The full weight of the law should be used to fine and imprison the perpetrators,
 to compensate the victims, and to safe-guard the rights of the innocent. Yet
 within this legal framework, we should permit the maximum degree of freedom in
 allowing people to choose what they think, act and do to themselves without harming
 others.</p>
<p>Convincing the public of our message, that &quot;persuasion instead of force
 is the sign of a civilized society,&quot; will require a lot of hard work, but
 it can be rewarding. The key is to make a convincing case for freedom, to present
 the facts to the public so that they can see the logic of our arguments, and
 to develop a dialogue with those who may be opposed to our position. Our emphasis
 must be on educating and persuading, not on arguing and name-calling. For we
 shall never change our political leaders until we change the people who elect
 them.</p>
<h4>A Vision of an Ideal Society</h4>
<p>Martin Luther King, Jr., gave a famous sermon at the Lincoln Memorial in the
 mid-1960s. In it, King said that he had a dream about the promised land. Well,
 I too have a vision of an ideal society.</p>
<p>I have a vision of world peace, not because the military have been called in
 to maintain order, but because we have peace from within and friendship with
 every nation.</p>
<p>I have a vision of universal prosperity and an end to poverty, not because
 of foreign aid or government-subsidized welfare, but because each of us has productive,
 useful employment where every trade is honest and beneficial to both buyer and
 seller, and where we eagerly help the less fortunate of our own free will.</p>
<p>I have a vision of an inflation-free nation, not because of wage and price
 controls, but because our nation has an honest money system.</p>
<p>I have a vision of a crime-free society, not because there's a policeman on
 every corner, but because we respect the rights and property of others.</p>
<p>I have a vision of a drug-free America, not because harmful drugs are illegal,
 but because we desire to live long, healthy, self-sustaining lives.</p>
<p>I have a vision of an abortion-free society, not because abortion is illegal,
 but because we firmly believe in the sanctity of life, sexual responsibility,
 and family values.</p>
<p>I have a vision of a pollution-free and environmentally sound world, not because
 of costly controls and arbitrary regulations, but because private enterprise
 honors its stewardship and commitment to developing rather than exploiting the
 earth's resources.</p>
<p>I have a vision of a free society, not because of a benevolent dictator commands
 it, but because we love freedom and the responsibility that goes with it.</p>
<p>The following words, taken from an old Protestant hymn whose author is fittingly
 anonymous, express the aspiration of every man and every woman in a free society.</p>
<center>
<p> Know this, that every soul is free<br>
 To choose his life and what he'll be;<br>
 For this eternal truth is given<br>
 That God will force no man to heaven.</p>
<p> He'll call, persuade, direct aright,<br>
 And bless with wisdom, love, and light,<br>
 In nameless ways be good and kind,<br>
 But never force the human mind.</p>

<a name="#author">Editor's note:<br>
 This article was reprinted from the September 1991, <a HREF="http://www.libertysoft.com/liberty/">Liberty</a> (Box 1167, Port Townsend,
 Washington - 98368). Generally, it advocates the same kind of fundamental change
 that <i>The Voluntaryist</i> seeks. Even though Dr. Skousen's emphasis is on &quot;educating
 the public,&quot; I suspect that he still supports electoral politics. Otherwise,
 there would be no reason for him to write (immediately after the words just quoted):
 &quot;For we shall never change [the attitudes and goals of] our political leaders
 until we change the [attitudes and desires of the] people who elect them.&quot;
 My immediate response is that we don't want &quot;political&quot; leaders. The
 point of the &quot;one at a time revolution&quot; is to make each person a self-governor
 so that political leaders are not only not necessary, but viewed as the criminal
 usurpers they really are.</p>
<p> As I wrote in my article, <a href="040.html">&quot;Cultivate Your Own Garden,&quot;</a> in Whole
 No. 40</p>
<p> Informed common sense says that &quot;political gains without philosophical
 understanding are potentially short-lived.&quot; ... [T]here is no reason to
 capture the seats of political power in order to disband the State. Just as voluntaryism
 occurs naturally if no one does anything to stop it, so will the State gradually
 disappear when those who oppose it stop supporting it. ... The only thing that
 the individual can do &quot;is to present society with 'one improved unit'.&quot;
 As <!--a HREF="http://users.aol.com/cre9ive/food.html#enemy"-->Albert Jay Nock<!--/a-->
 put it, &quot;[A]ges of experience testify that the only way
 society can be improved is by the individualist method...; that is, the method
 of each 'one' doing his very best to improve 'one'.&quot; This is the &quot;quiet&quot;
 or &quot;patient&quot; way of changing society because it concentrates upon bettering
 the character of men and women as individuals. As the individual units change,
 the improvement of society will take care of itself. In other words, &quot;If
 one takes care of the means, the end will take care of itself.&quot;</p>
<p> In concluding, I would like to commend Dr. Skousen for taking &quot;the high
 moral ground,&quot; as he puts it. He understands, as so few of our critics do,
 that just because we advocate allowing an activity (e.g., unrestricted drug usage),
 does not necessarily mean that we personally advocate participation in it. Of
 course, the other side of the coin, which our critics often miss, too, is that
 &quot;just because we don't support State-involvement in an activity (public
 schooling, for example), doesn't mean that we don't necessarily support that
 activity itself.&quot;</p>
