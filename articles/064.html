 <h2>Thoughts on Nonviolence</h2>
 <h4>by Karl Meyer<br>
  From Number 64 - October 1993<br>
  Reprinted from: <i>The Catholic Worker</i>, Oct. - Nov. 1992</h4>
</center>
<p> What is nonviolence? It is a way of life based on these human beliefs: Human
 conflicts can be resolved without violence or force; organized social aggression
 can be faced and turned back effectively without war and without killing anybody;
 most crime problems can be addressed more effectively without the use of violent
 methods or punishment or restraint; people well-educated in the use of nonviolent
 methods will almost always be more effective in human relations than those who
 use physical threats and weapons.</p>
<p>Commitment to nonviolence requires us to find solutions that address the needs
 and feelings of all parties. Resorting to violence means that one party will
 lose and be forced to give up when the other party wins. Nonviolence begins with
 respect for the needs and feelings of others, and a serious attempt to appreciate
 their point of view. The methods of nonviolence are communication, negotiation,
 mediation, arbitration and nonviolent forms of protest and resistance, when other
 forms of communication fail to resolve a conflict. When these methods are used
 with skill and persistence, most conflicts can be resolved without any party
 feeling the need to resort to violence. Organized, persistent nonviolent action
 can overcome oppression and resist aggression more effectively than violent means.</p>
<p>The fact is that all of us use nonviolent methods in most of our human relationships,
 most of the time. It would be a sorry world if we didn't. What would it be like
 if we used violence instead of negotiation every time that someone else had something
 that we wanted? What would it be like if we used violent retaliation every time
 that someone else did something that obstructed us or angered us? We use nonviolent
 methods in most of our family disputes. We use it in our schools, our work relationships
 and our commercial trading transactions. We use it in almost all relationships
 between communities within the established borders of nations, and in most relations
 between nations. </p>
<p>Many of us never resort to the explicit use of violence at all. Most others
 resort to it only in occasional situations.</p>
<p>We carry on most of our activities within a structure of law and customary
 principles of nonviolent relationship. It may seem that this structure is only
 held together by the ultimate threat of police force; but, in fact, the fabric
 of social realtionships in families, in groups and in larger communities has
 always been held together primarily by voluntary assent to common principles
 of social organization.</p>
<p>Throughout history it has been common to resolve conflicts between nations
 by warfare and the use of force. Yet even here the majority of relationships
 have been governed by negotiated agreements, treaties, laws and customs.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. did not invent nonviolence. Their
 instinctive contribution was to show how organized nonviolent action could solve
 intractable situations of longstanding oppression and conflict. Before them,
 others believed that these problems could not be solved, or could be solved only
 by violent revolt.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. King showed how we can take the nonviolent methods that
 we use most of the time in everyday relationships, and develop them as powerful
 tools to solve the most difficult problems of entrenched oppression and institutional
 violence.</p>
<p>We are all believers and practitioners of nonviolence in human relationships.
 The challenge is to extend our belief and our practical skills to more difficult
 and remote situations of human conflict. Those who really commit themselves to
 these principles find that they work. Many lives are saved. Destruction is avoided,
 and everyone benefits as the process develops.</p>
<p>Our politicians often tell us that it is impossible to resolve conflicts without
 war. The fact is that they don't try hard enough, because it is our lives and
 our well being that they put on the line when they decide that violence is necessary.<br>
