 <h2>Stateless, Not Lawless: Voluntaryism &amp; Arbitration</h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  Number 84 - Feb 1997</h4>
</center>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Arbitration is a consensual process whereby two parties to a dispute agree to
 accept as final the judgment of a third person or persons in settling the matter
 in question. Arbitration depends upon the consent and voluntary agreement of
 the disputants, and the willingness of the arbitrator(s) to serve. What distinguishes
 arbitration from all forms of State judicial settlement of disputes is its totally
 voluntary nature. Arbitrators are not licensed by the State (at least not yet).
 The disputing parties select the arbitrators and determine the procedure and
 rules by which their disagreement will be settled. They may agree in advance
 of any actual dispute to submit their differences to arbitration or they may
 simply agree to arbitrate an existing problem. The arbitral award or settlement
 decided upon by the arbitrator obtains its binding force from the contract or
 agreement of the parties to arbitrate, and does not require the coercive legal
 apparatus of the State to be respected or enforced. Nonviolent, non-State punishments
 may be brought to bear against those who, having promised to arbitrate or honor
 an arbitral award, refuse to do so. Ostracism, excommunication, and the boycott
 are arbitral sanctions that function in the spirit of true voluntaryism.</p>
<p>Arbitration is undoubtedly as old as mankind, and is certainly older, as an
 institution, than the near-monopoly court systems we find in use in the contemporary
 nation-state. Arbitration has been favored in all the ancient legal systems (Jewish,
 Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Islamic, and Christian), except that of the Chinese,
 who believed that &quot;going to law&quot; or court was an evil. (The Chinese,
 while using mediation and conciliation, have always been reluctant to give third
 parties the right to make a judgement.) It is probably not an exaggeration, as
 Jerzy Jakubowski has written, to say that arbitration &quot;is a universal human
 institution. It is [the] product of a universal human need and desire for the
 equitable solution of differences inevitably arising from time to time between
 people by an impartial person having the confidence of and authority from&quot;
 the disputants themselves.</p>
<p>Wherever arbitration has existed, it has posed a threat to the supremacy of
 the State judicial system. Consequently, it has been co-opted, regulated, and
 controlled by the State, making its legal history a complex, and sometimes confusing,
 tangle. The purpose of this article is to offer an overview of arbitration, both
 past and current, interpreted from a voluntaryist point of view. Voluntaryists
 advocate an all voluntary society, where all the affairs of people are undertaken
 by mutual consent or not at all. In the absence of coercive, tax-supported governments
 which tend to monopolize the judicial settlement of disputes, arbitration and
 other voluntary dispute settlement practices would flourish and constitute an
 integral part of civilized life. The old Law Merchant, which was &quot;voluntarily
 produced, voluntarily adjudicated, and voluntarily enforced,&quot; and the international
 commercial arbitration practices of today prove that arbitration is a moral and
 practical alternative to compulsory dispute settlement by the State.</p>
<p>Most people assume that nation-states are prerequisites for producing &quot;law
 and order&quot;, and find it difficult to envision a competitive market in the
 judicial arena. As voluntaryists already realize, such is not the case. If the
 truth be known, the compulsory nation-state is destructive, rather than supportive,
 of property rights and the voluntary social order. Bruce Benson, whose scholarly
 work in this area I wish to acknowledge, once characterized the American Wild
 West of the mid-1800s (where coercive government was either absent or extremely
 weak) as &quot;stateless, but not lawless.&quot; Benson would have us focus on
 the fact that liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of civilized living. Property,
 contracts, and customary law existed before State-made law tried to supercede
 them. As Benson and others have noted, private property is a key characteristic
 of all societies where custom is the primary source of law, and where reciprocity
 is the primary impetus for meeting one's obligations.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with arbitration? Arbitration is one of the key sources
 of voluntary law and order in a society without the State. Every contract or
 voluntary agreement between two or more people contains within itself the essence
 of the rules governing the transaction(s) between them. These &quot;homemade&quot;
 laws or rules derive their power from the consent of the parties, and usually
 differ markedly from statutory or third-party law (often arbitrarily) imposed
 upon them by the State with its power of legislative law-making. The essence
 of this idea can be seen in a conflict between International Business Machines
 Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd., that occurred during the late 1980s, which included an
 arbitral award of $833.3 million to IBM. IBM claimed that Fujitsu was copying
 its software, which then enabled Fujitsu to market computers that were compatible
 with IBM's. Government-made copyright law did not clearly address the issue of
 such a complex software-hardware dispute, because technology had forged ahead
 into areas never before addressed by State-made law. Shedding the courts, their
 own legal staffs and lawyers, and four years of wrangling over the issue, the
 two companies decided to appoint two arbitrators to settle the issue. The two
 arbitrators were given &quot;sweeping powers to shape future software relations
 between IBM and Fujitsu. The two men, in their own words, will 'constitute the
 intellectual property law between the two companies'.&quot; (Wall Street Journal,
 Sept. 18, 1987, A1)</p>
<h3>History of Arbitration</h3>
<p>While much of this article will focus on the various aspects and significance
 of domestic and international commercial arbitration, such as the IBM-Fujitsu
 case, there are important reasons for considering the use of arbitration in other
 areas of life. Arbitration can be, and has been resorted to, in many other types
 of situations involving community, club, or congregational disputes, patient
 complaints against hospitals or doctors, in divorce proceedings, and in attorney-client
 disputes. Arbitration has been widely used in resolving labor disputes, as well
 as in settling consumer complaints against retail businesses. Currently in Japan,
 arbitration is sometimes used to determine the amount of restitution a criminal
 owes to his or her victim. With a little imagination arbitration can be applied
 to almost any facet of life. Two examples will suffice to demonstrate.</p>
<p>The first is found in Jerold Auerbaclis book, <em>Justice Without Law?</em>,
 and describes the effects of an arbitral case in Puritan New England in the early
 1640s. The dispute involved the amount to be paid by a Mrs. Hibbens, &quot;wife
 of a prominent Boston resident,&quot; and Mr. Crabtree, who provided carpentry
 services in her house. When neither of the two could agree on how much Crabtree
 was due, Mr. Hibbens suggested arbitration. He &quot;chose one carpenter and
 Crabtree another. The arbitrators set a revised fee, but Mrs. Hibbens remained
 obdurate.&quot; She not only found Crabtree's work unsatisfactory, but cast aspersions
 on the skills of the two arbitrators, &quot;which diminished their reputation
 in the community. Church elders approached Mrs. Hibbens, but she remained unmollified.
 After another arbitration attempt failed, the dispute moved into the First Church
 of Boston, where Reverend Cotton presided.&quot;</p>
<p>The focus of the dispute now shifted &quot;from a disagreement over wages to
 the stubborn recalcitrance of a church member who did not respect communal fellowship.&quot;
 Not only did Mrs. Hibbens gossip behind the backs of the carpenter-arbitrators,
 she refused to confront them face-to-face, in a&quot;church way,&quot; as required
 by congregational rules. Ultimately, Mrs. Hibbens' behavior was judged by the
 entire church membership, &quot;in a process designed to reassert harmony and
 consensus.&quot; As Auerbach pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congregants were free to offer information, opinion, and admonition, but the
 purpose of individual participation was to encourage a collective congregational
 judgment, which would isolate offenders, restore them to congregational fellowship,
 and thereby strengthen communal values. The sanctions of admonition and excommunication
 were sufficient for this purpose. The church could neither arrest a wrongdoer
 nor seize his property, but the danger of expulsion, where church and community
 were virtually co-extensive, loomed ominously. [p.24] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was Mrs. Hibbens' fate. She was excommunicated by a vote of the church
 membership, pronounced &quot;a leprous and unclean person,&quot; and deprived
 of &quot;the enjoymentent of all those blessed privileges and ordinances which
 God hath entrusted his Church withal, which [she had] so long abused.&quot;</p>
<p>How many Americans know that George Washington placed an arbitration clause
 in his Last Will and Testament in 1799? Washington hoped that no conflicts would
 arise concerning the testamentary disposition of his property. However, he provided
 that &quot;all disputes (if unhappily any should arise) shall be decided by three
 impartial and intelligent men, known for their probity and good understanding;
 two to be chosen by the disputants each having the choice of one and the third
 by the two of those. Which three men thus chosen, shall, unfettered by Law, or
 legal constructions, declare their intent of the Testators intention; and such
 decision is to all intents and purposes to be as binding on the Parties as if
 it had been given in the Supreme Court of the United States.&quot; So far as
 is known the provisions of this clause went unexercised.</p>
<p>Business arbitration in this country and Europe certainly pre-dated Washington's
 will. Americans used arbitration during the Stamp Act crisis of 1765-66 when
 their refusal to pay British taxes blocked their access to colonial courts. In
 May 1768, the New York Chamber of Commerce appointed an arbitration committee
 &quot;for the settlement of commercial disputes outside of the courts.&quot;
 Referred to as &quot;the oldest American tribunal,&quot; the New York Chamber
 of Commerce &quot;has continuously, except for a short time at the beginning
 of [the 20th] century, maintained some form of arbitration procedure.&quot; The
 New York Stock Exchange, founded in 1792, provided for arbitration in its Constitution
 of 1817. The oldest arbitral institution in the cotton trade is to be found in
 Liverpool, England, where the first rules of cotton trading, which included rules
 governing arbitration, were published in 1863 by the Liverpool Cotton Exchange.
 Likewise, the first rules of the New York Cotton Exchange, founded in 1870 provided
 for a court of arbitration. The Dried Fruit Association of New York (now the
 Association of Food Distributors, Inc.) still maintains an arbitration tribunal
 which has been in continuous existence since the time of the group's founding
 in 1906. One of the Association's officials, writing in 1958, pointed out that
 it was not unusual for a request for arbitration to be received in the morning,
 and the arbitral award be issued the same afternoon. This was most desirable
 where the commodity in question was perishable and where it needed to be moved
 before the free time on the dock expired.</p>
<p>As William Wooldridge has pointed out in his chapter on &quot;Voluntary Justice,&quot;
 arbitration has always played an essential part in the workings of the Law Merchant.
 For several hundred years, arbitral tribunals composed of merchants and guildsmen
 settled &quot;the most important trading disputes of England and of much of Europe.&quot;
 The Law Merchant constituted &quot;the body of customary rules and principles
 relating to merchants and mercantile transactions and adopted by traders themselves
 for the purpose of regulating their dealings.&quot; These institutions were completely
 voluntary, &quot;and if a man ignored their judgment, he [w]ould not be sent
 to jail.&quot; Their decisions were well-respected, &quot;otherwise people would
 have never used them in the first place.&quot; No one forced a merchant to abide
 by his agreements or coerced him into honoring an arbitral award. His failure
 to do so would not place him in jail, but &quot;neither would he long continue
 to be a merchant.&quot; As Wooldridge put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The complete circumvention of official courts, one of the oldest and best
 established of civilized institutions, and the voluntary forfeiture of what would
 seem to be the most fundamental and essential characteristic of any court-the
 ability to enforce its judgments with legal coercion-present interesting questions
 .... [M]edieval merchants must have considered their interests better served
 by voluntary submission of disputes to one of their own than by formal common-law
 actions. [p.96]. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarence Birdseye, author of <em>Arbitration and Business Ethics</em> (1926),
 once guessed that as many business disputes went to arbitration as were settled
 by the statist courts. He also observed that these commercial arbitrations &quot;had
 no direct sanction of law, and were dependent only upon the mutual good faith
 of the parties for their operation and success.&quot; [p.91] The threat of business
 sanctions and the desire for reciprocity were the primary motivations businessmen
 had for voluntarily living up to their promises.</p>
<p>Until the early 1920s, court decisions, some dating back to the 17th and 18th
 Centuries, governed arbitration proceedings in the United States. Lord Coke's
 opinion in Vynior's Case (Trinity Term, 7 Jac. 1), decided in 1609, formed the
 basis for the common law doctrine that &quot;1) either party to an arbitration
 might withdraw at any time before an actual award; and 2) that an agreement to
 arbitrate a future dispute was against public policy and not enforceable.&quot;
 The precedent established in Vynior's case (from which it was extrapolated that
 the parties to a dispute &quot;may not oust the court of its jurisdiction&quot;-meaning
 that courts may not be deprived of their jurisdiction even by private agreement)
 became &quot;the controlling decision in American arbitration law&quot; until
 the New York State legislature abrogated the common law doctrine in 1920, and
 until a federal arbitration statute was passed in 1925. Other states soon followed
 suit, and for the first time in America, agreements to arbitrate future disputes
 were &quot;legally binding and judicially enforceable.&quot;</p>
<p>These new laws actually undermined the credibility of commercial arbitration.
 Arbitration had flourished for hundreds of years in the absence of any State-guarantee
 that arbitration agreements would be enforced by the courts. History had already
 clearly demonstrated that mercantile conformity to arbitration agreements did
 not depend upon the existence of the State or its enforcement mechanisms. The
 Law Merchant had always prohibited appeals of arbitration awards. Arbitration
 tribunals were designed to avoid unnecessary litigation, as well as to render
 timely decisions which would not disrupt the pace of business transactions. The
 laws of the 1920s opened many a Pandora's box by raising a host of questions
 about how the new statutes would be enforced, and by creating the opportunity
 to appeal arbitral awards to the courts. As Bruce Benson noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> [T]he incentives to develop non-legal sanctions [had been] undermined by these
 statutes.... [I]t does not follow that in the absence of modern arbitration statutes
 the level of arbitration would be dramatically less than it is today.</p>
<p> Lawyers would be less prevalent, and there would be fewer appeals, but because...stronger
 incentives would exist to develop mechanisms for the imposition of reputational
 sanctions, arbitration would be flourishing, even outside existing associations
 and exchanges. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>International Commercial Arbitration</h3>
<p>In POWER AND MARKET, Murray Rothbard pointed out that &quot;the world has lived
 quite well throughout its existence without a single, ultimate decision-maker
 over its whole inhabited surface.&quot; [p.3] As an example of how the world
 fared under this anarchical reign, he could have pointed to the medieval Law
 Merchant, which served as international legal system that governed without the
 coercive power of a centralized political state. Likewise, its successor today,
 international commercial law &quot;is still largely enforced without the backing
 of nation-states.&quot; Bruce Benson claims that &quot;The international Law
 Merchant can be viewed as a constitutionality established system of governance
 for the international business community ... despite the lack of politically
 defined geographic boundaries and a centralized authority with coercive power
 to tax and punish.&quot; The most significant contribution of the international
 Law Merchant lies in the development of arbitration between two businessmen of
 perhaps different nationalities, conducting business across two or more political
 boundaries.</p>
<p>The history of modern international commercial arbitration began in Paris,
 France under the auspices of the international Chamber of Commerce founded in
 1921. The ICC International Court of Arbitration was established in 1923, and
 as of May 1994, had handled some 8000 cases involving international commercial
 disputes. The rules of the Chamber embrace a number of Law Merchant concepts.
 &quot;The ICC rules provide that arbitrators should be selected from different
 national origins, thereby preserving an international flavor in dispute resolution.
 So, too, ICC arbitrators are required to be experts in commercial conciliation
 and in international arbitration, again reviving the commercial sophistication
 of the merchant judge. Finally, the ICC procedures provide for the speedy settlement
 of disputes through a flexible conciliation procedure, and, failing that, an
 adaptable arbitral process. Here, too, the ideal of an expeditious and low cost
 arbitration process is partially embodied in the ICC Rules.&quot; The primary
 benefit of using ICC Rules, or the rules of some other arbitration agency, like
 the American Arbitration Association, is that the parties to a dispute do not
 have to create their own procedures in an ad hoc manner. The ICC Rules are widely
 publicized, predictable, and easily used. &quot;The International Court of Arbitration
 administers and supervises ICC arbitrations from the introduction of a request
 for arbitration to the rendering of a final Award. Disputes are not settled by
 the Court itself but by independent arbitrators-appointed or confirmed by the
 Court-who deal with the merits of a case.&quot; The Court of Arbitration serves
 to protect the integrity of the arbitral process, provides lists of qualified
 arbitrators, and reviews each award before it is finalized. The National Committees
 of Arbitration, which function under the ICC, often offer moral assistance in
 upholding ICC awards, and often form interarbitral agreements acceptable to their
 merchant members.</p>
<p>Jan Paulsson, a French practitioner of international arbitration, writing in
 the early 1980s claimed that over 90% of all arbitral awards issued under the
 auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce were complied with. Charles
 Carabiber in his article in Martin Domke's collection, <em>International Trade
 Arbitration</em> (New York: 1958) noted that, &quot;The private character of
 arbitration eliminates the possibility of statistics and consequently it is not
 generally known that 85% of [international] arbitral awards are complied with.
 This figure was obtained from information given by several arbitration centers
 of long standing.&quot; [p.163] These ballpark estimates were further confirmed
 by Rene David, in a 1982 book review of his own book, &quot;Arbitration in International
 Trade&quot;, which appeared in <em>The Art of Arbitration</em>. Regarding compliance
 with international arbitral awards, David wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Account must be taken, first of all, of the fact that parties to a contract
 do in most cases perform their duties under the contract without bothering what
 the law-any national law-says about the matter... The losing party will ordinarily
 voluntarily comply with the arbitration award. He may be dissatisfied, but his
 commercial reputation is at stake, good faith impels him also to comply; he will
 abstain from the niceties of some lawyer's law which might perhaps allow him
 an opportunity to challenge the award. Ninety percent of the arbitral agreements
 are complied with; ninety percent of the awards are voluntarily performed without
 raising the question whether they would be enforceable or not &quot;at law.&quot;
 [p.91] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time that the national movement for statutory arbitration was gaining
 ground in the United States, there was a similar movement among the major trading
 nations of the Western world. Under the guise of embracing international treaties
 to assure the enforcement of international arbitral awards, these nation-States
 attempted to retain control over the arbitral process. The Geneva Protocol on
 Arbitration Clauses of September 24, 1923, and the Geneva Convention on the Execution
 of Foreign Arbitral Awards of September 30,1927, were the results of these efforts.
 Essentially these international agreements provided that each contracting State
 &quot;is required to recognize as binding and to enforce awards rendered in the
 territory of another contracting State.&quot; Some of the difficulties encountered
 under these treaties were removed with the passage of the New York Convention
 of June 19,1958, sponsored by the United Nations. By 1982, nearly 60 nations
 had signed this document. The New York Convention severely restricted the reasons
 for questioning a foreign arbitral award by the judiciary of the country in which
 it was being enforced. &quot;The onus of proving that the award is not enforceable
 is shifted to the defendant resisting enforcement under the New York Convention.&quot;</p>
<h3>Gotaverken vs. General National Maritime</h3>
<p>Three arbitral awards rendered in Paris, France on April 5, 1978 will serve
 to illustrate the working and rules of arbitration of the International Chamber
 of Commerce, describe their relationship to the New York Convention of 1958,
 and highlight the issue of party autonomy, by which the arbitration process is
 divorced from State-made law. ICC case numbers 2977,2978, and 3033 involved the
 Swedish shipbuilder, Gotaverken Arendal AB (the large Gothenburg shipyard) and
 the buyer of three newly-constructed tankers, the General National Maritime Transport
 Company (later succeeded by the Libyan General Maritime Transport Organization).
 The sales contracts included a clause, according to which &quot;all disputes
 arising from or in connection with the present contract ... shall be finally
 settled by arbitration ... [to] be held in Paris and conducted in accordance
 with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration then in force of the International
 Chamber of Commerce. The award shall be final, binding ... and each party agrees
 to abide by such decision....&quot; Construction on the vessels had begun after
 a $90 million down payment had been made. Upon completion, Libyan General refused
 to take delivery or pay the balance outstanding because 1) contract provisions
 prohibiting the use of components made in Israel had been violated, and 2) certain
 technical specifications had not been met. Gotaverken rejected these arguments
 and initiated arbitral proceedings in accord with the contract.</p>
<p>The dispute was submitted to ICC arbitration in Paris, and the arbitral tribunal
 was composed of a French chairman, a Norwegian, and a Libyan. By a two-to-one
 decision (which the Libyan arbitrator refused to sign), the tribunal rejected
 Libyan General's claims. Libyan General was ordered to accept delivery of the
 ships and to pay the outstanding purchase price, less a reduction amounting to
 about 2% for deviations from specifications. When Libyan General would not voluntarily
 comply with the arbitral ruling, Gotaverken petitioned the Svea Court of Appeal
 for the enforcement of the award in Sweden. Libyan General opposed this request
 on the ground that it had already begun appeal proceedings in France. It had
 petitioned the Court of Appeal of Paris to set aside the award. When the Svea
 Court of Appeal upheld the arbitration, Libyan General then instituted an appeal
 to the Swedish Supreme Court, asking that the Svea Court's judgment be set aside,
 or at least held in abeyance until the proceedings before the Court of Appeal
 of Paris had been decided.</p>
<p>The basis for the Libyan appeals was 1) under French national law governing
 arbitral awards, the mere fact that an application for setting aside the award
 was before the Courts caused the award to be temporarily suspended; 2) the arbitral
 award was self- contradictory in that it acknowledged the vessels failed to meet
 contract specifications, yet ordered Libyan General to take delivery; and 3)
 it would subject Libyan General to criminal sanctions in Libya for violation
 of boycott legislation; and finally 4) the arbitral decision violated the French
 public order &quot;because it imposed on a foreign contracting party an obligation
 contrary to the imperative norms of its home country&quot; (i.e., violation of
 the boycott law). Libyan General's strategy was to challenge the award in France,
 and thereby argue &quot;that the award was not binding anywhere pending its challenge
 before the courts in the country where it was rendered.&quot;</p>
<p>The Svea Court of Appeals upheld the arbitral award in a decision issued December
 13, 1978, and the Swedish Court of Appeals affirmed the Svea judgment on August
 13, 1979. Both courts agreed that the French courts had no jurisdiction over
 the arbitration award, even though the arbitration proceedings had taken place
 on French soil. Article 11 of the ICC Rules (revised as of 1975) provided</p>
<blockquote>
<p> The rules governing the proceedings before the arbitrator shall be those resulting
 from these Rules and, where these Rules are silent, any rules which the parties
 or, failing them, the arbitrator) may settle, and whether or not reference is
 thereby made to a municipal procedural law to be applied to the arbitration.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the Swedish courts concluded that &quot;<em>the challenged award was
 not French in nationality.</em>&quot; Under both the New York Convention of 1958
 and the ICC Rules of arbitration, the law of the place of arbitration would control
 the proceedings only in the absence of a specific agreement by the parties. Since
 in this case the parties had agreed to ICC Rules, the municipal law of France
 did not apply. Consequently, both the Svea Court of Appeal and the Swedish Supreme
 Court based their &quot;decision not to take jurisdiction on the principle that
 parties to international arbitral proceedings are free to select the legal order
 to which they wish to attach the proceedings, and this freedom extends to the
 exclusion of any national system of law.&quot; Furthermore, they viewed the award
 as binding on the parties from the moment it was issued in Paris, and hence not
 appealable because &quot;an award would not be binding if it were liable to an
 appeal.&quot;</p>
<p>The appeal before the Court of appeal of Paris by Libyan General to set aside
 the ICC award was declared invalid in a judgment rendered February 21, 1980.
 The Court of Appeal pointed out that 1) none of the parties or the arbitrators
 had designated any procedural law to govern the arbitration; 2) therefore the
 only binding rules were those of the ICC; and 3) the arbitral award could not
 be considered a French award because there was no connecting link to the French
 legal system, because neither of the parties were French, nor was the contract
 to be performed on French soil; and 4) that under the New York Convention of
 1958, the winning party need not &quot;as a precondition to enforcement elsewhere,
 seek confirmation of the award by the courts of the country where it was rendered&quot;;
 or conversely, the country of the seat of arbitration (in this case, France)
 need not recognize the arbitral award in order for it to be recognized and enforced
 elsewhere (in this case, in Sweden). The ultimate effect of all three court decisions
 (two in Sweden and one in France) was to allow Gotaverken to exercise its right
 of attachment over the three ships, and to proceed with a judicial auction of
 the ships in order to satisfy its lien against them.</p>
<h3>Party Autonomy or State Control</h3>
<p>The decision in the Gotaverken case set off a debate among lawyers, jurists,
 and academics because it presented the question of whether or not it was possible
 for parties to international arbitration agreements to structure the proceeding
 and the resulting award so as to be totally independent of the jurisdiction of
 any nation-state. Could the parties divorce themselves from State control by
 private agreement, even though their arbitration proceedings had to occur in
 the territory of some nation-state? Jan Paulsson came closest to supporting the
 voluntaryist position when he maintained that &quot;the binding force of an international
 [arbitral] award [is] derived from the contractual commitment to arbitrate in
 and of itself that is to say, without a specific national legal system serving
 as its foundation.&quot; Others, such as F. A. Mann, defended the statist position
 that nothing is legal except what the State permits. Mann maintained that in
 reality there was no such thing as international arbitration because every &quot;international&quot;
 arbitration was &quot;subject to a specific system of national law.&quot; As
 he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> No one has ever or anywhere been able to point to any provision or legal principle
 which we permit individuals to act outside the confines of a system of municipal
 law. Every arbitration is subject to the law of a given State. No private person
 has the right or the power to act on any level other than that of municipal law.
 Every right or power a private person enjoys is inexorably conferred by or derived
 from a system of municipal law .... [p.160] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mann presents some very fundamental questions about the nature of the State.
 &quot;<em>Is not every activity occurring on the territory of a State necessarily
 subject to its jurisdiction</em>&quot; even if the participants desire to remove
 themselves from its control? He admits that some States may give the parties
 more leeway in this regard, but he observes that no State has ever totally abdicated
 its control over what takes place in its geographic territory. Thus Mann concludes
 that &quot;No act of the parties can have any legal effect except as the result
 of the sanction given to it by a [specific State's] legal system.&quot; [p.161]
 The principle of party autonomy is an illusion, and the municipal law of the
 seat of the arbitration must be the law governing the arbitral award. As he adds,
 &quot;It would be intolerable if the country of the seat [of the arbitration]
 could not override whatever arrangements the parties may have made. The local
 sovereign does not yield to them except as the result of freedoms granted by
 himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Jakubowski is another who concurs that, &quot;States have adopted the principle
 of their exclusive jurisdiction to settle disputes between people,&quot; but
 then admits that certain exceptions (one of them being arbitration) have been
 granted to non-State courts. He says that the State and State courts are clearly
 necessary, if for no other reason, than they provide the only final means of
 dispute settlement. As Jakubowski puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Arbitration could act outside the limits of the State's 'concession', but
 in such a case the winning party would depend for the performance of obligations
 established in the arbitral award, on the good will of the other party. Because
 of the uncertainty of whether the award will be carried out by the losing party,
 the guarantees of legislation and the assistance of the State are indispensable
 for arbitration. Practice has shown the limited effectiveness of social pressures
 (in international trade the pressure of business circles and professional organizations
 of businessmen, e.g., chambers of commerce) as a means of enforcing arbitral
 awards. [p.178] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Jakubowski's evaluation of arbitration history clearly conflicts with
 that of Benson and Wooldridge, he at least grants that it is possible for transnational
 arbitration to function in a manner wholly divorced from the State, provided
 the arbitration process depends only on non-State enforcement mechanisms. Mann,
 on the other hand, upholds the supremacy of State law, even when the parties
 want nothing to do with it:</p>
<blockquote>
 <p> How do we, how do arbitrators, know that their decision, based on their standards
  of fairness, is [fairer] than the law? Absolute perfection not being attainable,
  it is infinitely more dangerous to allow discretion to arbitrators than to compel
  [the] parties to accept the law, its relative certainty, its authority and,
  above all, its nondiscriminatory character. <em>The law is rarely an instrument
  of oppression.</em> [p.176, emphasis added] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The law is always &quot;an instrument of oppression&quot; because, unlike arbitration,
 it does not require the consent of the parties. There is a need for the final
 and conclusive settlement of disputes, but it is a false assumption to behave
 that the coercive State is the only way to achieve this objective. The free market
 approach to this problem is to let the disputing parties themselves select from
 among competing agencies, all of which offer dispute settlement services. The
 voluntaryist position is that competing institutions of final dispute settlement
 would exist (and, in fact, have existed, as arbitration history proves), would
 not require the State to function, and that the State's involvement in the process
 is not supportive, but only destructive.</p>
<p>&quot;An institution of initiated force is not necessary to compel disputants
 to treat arbitration as binding. The principle of rational self-interest, on
 which the whole free market system is built, would accomplish this end quite
 effectively.&quot; There is not only a moral satisfaction in acting out one's
 honesty, but there is an economic benefit, too. Linda and Morris Tannehill point
 out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Men who contract to abide by the decision of a neutral arbiter and then break
 that contract are obviously unreliable and too risky to do business with. Honest
 men, acting in their rational self-interest, would check the records of those
 they did business with and would avoid having dealings with any such individuals.
 This kind of informal business boycott would be extremely effective in a governmentless
 society .... [p. 66] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a society without a State, no judicial or arbitration agency would have
 compulsory jurisdiction, by which they could drag unwilling participants into
 court. Of course, it would be possible to try a defendant in absentia and issue
 a boycott judgment against a convicted party. The &quot;convicted&quot; would
 suffer as a result of the social consequences of his actions, even though no
 invasive force would be inflicted directly upon him.</p>
<p>The Tannehills have also pointed out that &quot;a court system which has a
 monopoly guaranteed by the force of statutory law will not give as good quality
 service as will free market arbitration agencies which must compete for their
 customers.&quot; This is similar to the observation made by Bruce Benson and
 others that under a customary law system, &quot;the more effective institutional
 arrangements replace the less effective ones.&quot; In other words, where customers
 are free to migrate between competing judicial and arbitration agencies, they
 will choose to patronize those that offer the best quality service at the lowest
 possible prices. As Bruce Benson explained in THE ENTERPRISE OF LAW, &quot;there
 appears to be substantial benefit from not having monopoly [as in a single legal
 system], just as there is for the production of all other goods and services.&quot;
 [p.300]</p>
<h3>Arbitration and the (voluntaryist) Sources of Law and Order</h3>
<p>Imagine for an instant, as William Vandersteel posited in No. 14 of <em>The
 Voluntaryist</em>, that you had to operate in both your social life and business
 life as though you had no State courts to resort to in the event that someone
 caused you a harm or failed to abide by their contractual agreements. You would
 not be able to employ coercive third party enforcement measures. Two countervailing
 tendencies would come into operation. First of all, you would be very careful
 with whom you had dealings. You would only want to interact with those who had
 a first-rate reputation and an honorable record of fulfilling their promises
 in all circumstances. Your second inclination would be to guard your own reputation
 to the utmost. &quot;Individuals would strive always to act properly and with
 the highest integrity, knowing that any blemish on their reputation would virtually
 bar them from participating in any future business ventures.&quot;</p>
<p>If we define customary law as a legal system which develops from the bottom
 up through voluntary arrangements, we will discover that such a system operates
 in much the same manner as envisioned by Vandersteel. Bruce Benson in his article
 &quot;The Impetus for Recognizing Private Property and Adopting Ethical Behavior,&quot;
 notes that among small groups of people who frequently interact, there is little
 need for formal institutional arrangements to insure credible behavior. Everyone
 is knowledgeable about everyone else's reputation. As the size of the group expands,
 the likelihood of dealing with someone whose reputation is not known is increased,
 as well as the probability that some person(s) might not fulfill their promises.
 &quot;Therefore, for such expansion to occur, each party's commitments to accept
 commonly accepted norms of behavior must be credible.&quot; [p.51]</p>
<p>If a dispute arises between people belonging to different mutual support groups,
 the disputants may either resort to violent self-help, abandon their claim against
 the other party, or attempt to negotiate a peaceful settlement. Mutual support
 groups, whether family, commercial, or social, not only strengthen the position
 of the solitary individual, but they also act as a means of sharing the expense
 of dispute settlement. Violence, whether individual or in concert with others,
 is almost always more expensive than a peaceful resolution. Thus &quot;acceptance
 of nonviolent dispute resolution will become a customary obligation that is required
 for group membership,&quot; and the &quot;resort to violence without first trying
 to achieve a nonviolent solution will result in ostracism by the group.&quot;
 [p.53]</p>
<p>Arbitration plays a pivotal and important part in this process of peaceful
 dispute settlement. Benson describes how boycott and ostracism work under the
 customary law, and it is readily apparent how this applies to arbitration in
 the absence of a State enforcement apparatus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> [C]ustomary law is tightly bound with all other aspects of life. Fear of this
 boycott sanction reinforces the self-interest motives associated with the maintenance
 of reputation and reciprocal arrangements. It also deters intentional offenses.
 In other words, because each individual has made an investment in establishing
 himself as part of the community, (e.g., establishing a reputation), that investment
 can be &quot;held hostage&quot; by the community, in order to insure that the
 commitment to cooperate is credible. [p.54] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under a customary law system, arbitration &quot;decisions can be enforced without
 the backing of a centralized coercive authority.&quot; [p.55] The key to dispute
 settlement process in customary law systems is that the loser must &quot;buy
 back his reputation&quot; by honoring the arbitral award. Failure to do so will
 result in his ostracism by the entire group. The individual is faced with the
 choice of living as a social outcast or honoring his commitment to abide by the
 result of the arbitration. Under such a system, the same incentives apply to
 the arbitrator as well as to the disputants. Arbitrators must be acceptable to
 both sides of a dispute.</p>
<p>The arbitrator's &quot;only real power is to persuasion&quot; and he relies
 upon the consent of the parties, which he has obtained before hand, to insure
 that they will abide by his award. The arbitrator is concerned with the fairness
 of his judgement, since his own reputation and standing in the community are
 at stake if either party to the arbitration refuses to honor his decision.</p>
<p>Benson also demonstrates how the customary law of non-violent sanctions can
 operate among members of different support groups, where normally there would
 be little potential for the boycott sanction to be effectively applied by a member
 of one group against a member of another group. &quot;Each individual must feel
 confident that someone from the other group will not be able to take advantage
 of him and then escape to the protection of that other group. Thus, some sort
 of intra-group insurance arrangement becomes desirable&quot; and some sort of
 formalized dispute settlement apparatus is set up between the groups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> For instance, in order to develop a group's reputation the membership might
 bond all members in the sense that they will guarantee payment if a member is
 judged to be in the wrong in a dispute with someone from the other group. The
 mutual support group becomes a surety group as well. Membership in a group then
 serves as a signal of reputable behavior to members of another group, and lack
 of membership serves as a signal that an individual may not be reputable [or
 at least that he has no surety backing]. Furthermore, if a member of one group
 cannot or will not pay off a debt to someone in the other group, [as] established
 by an acceptable arbitrator, then the debtor's group as a whole will [pay the
 debt] in order to maintain the benefits of the group's reputation. And as a consequence,
 the individual for whom the group has had to pay will owe his own group members
 rather than someone from a separate group. [This is known as subrogation in the
 contemporary insurance industry. Letters of credit in the banking industry serve
 the same purpose.] In this way the boycott threat comes into play once again.
 Members of a group are not going to continue bonding an individual who generates
 debts to the group's membership but does not pay them off. [By this process of
 subrogation, the] large long-term benefits of intra-group interaction [and] the
 self interest incentives to maintain intra-group relationships come [back] into
 play. [p.62] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How effective are these non-State sanctions? How do shunning, excommunication
 and the boycott operate? In his book, <em>What is Mutualism?</em> (1927), Clarence Lee
 Swartz wrote:</p>
<blockquote
<p> Under certain circumstances the boycott and its companion, ostracism, may
 constitute a most drastic penalty. On account of the gregarious habits of human
 beings, to be put wholly beyond the pale of society would be more painful to
 many than to be incarcerated in a prison with others.... It is simple; it is
 easily and inexpensively applied; it involves, theoretically, none of the elements
 of physical force; and, above all, it is not an invasive act. What more ideal
 method of correcting the erring tendencies and antisocial activities of our fellow-men
 can be conceived? [pp.165-166] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly these observations are true with respect to one of the best known
 historical examples of excommunication, which involved Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677)
 in 1656. Spinoza's excommunication, known in Hebrew as a 'kherem'or'herem', was
 pronounced by the Jewish rabbis of Amsterdam because he denied the existence
 of angels, &quot;the immortality of the soul, and Gods authorship of the Torah.&quot;
 No Jew was to conduct business with him, stand within four paces of him, or even
 speak to him. The decree of kherem meant&quot;the virtual expulsion of the person
 upon whom it was inflicted,&quot; and his exclusion &quot;from the religious
 and social life of the community.&quot; Recognizing the severity of the consequences,
 the Rabbinic authorities did not permit its use except in the most serious cases.</p>
<p>The Jewish custom of &quot;Kherem&quot; is also the underlying basis for the
 everyday functioning of the world's diamond bourses. Jews have been involved
 in the diamond trade since the Middle Ages, congregating in Antwerp and Amsterdam,
 after they were expelled from Spain in 1492. &quot;The diamond industry has systematically
 rejected state created law.&quot; In its stead, a highly sophisticated system
 of private governance has evolved which relies upon mandatory pre-arbitration
 conciliation and arbitration. There is a striking parallel between Orthodox &quot;Jewish
 law and the modern organization of the diamond industry.&quot; As Lisa Bernstein
 has noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> [U]nder Jewish law, a Jew is forbidden to voluntarily go into the courts of
 non-Jews to resolve commercial disputes with another Jew. Should he do so, he
 is to be ridiculed and shamed. Jewish law also provides rules governing the making
 of oral contracts and lays down rules for conducting commercial arbitration.
 In the diamond industry, Jewish law provided a code of commercial fair dealing
 that gradually adapted to meet the industry's changing needs; yet, even as the
 force of religious law broke down, the system remained strong. [p.141] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even today, &quot;the largest and most important&quot; diamond bourse in the
 United States, the New York Diamond Dealers Club, has a large Jewish membership.
 Each member, upon joining, agrees &quot;to submit all disputes arising from the
 diamond business between himself and another member to the club's arbitration
 system,&quot; which is final, binding, and non-appealable to the New York State
 courts. Should a member violate this agreement, the Club's Floor Committee will
 impose either a fine or expulsion. In the latter case, the errant member's name
 and photo are posted in bourses all over the world, so that he is effectively
 prevented from participating in the foreign diamond trade. The New York Diamond
 Dealers Club, in turn, is affiliated with the World Federation of Diamond Bourses,
 which is an organization composed of the world's twenty diamond bourses. Each
 of these courses extends trading privileges to members in-good-standing in their
 local diamond trading club. &quot;As a condition of membership in the federation,
 each bourse is required to enforce the arbitration judgments of all member bourses.&quot;
 In addition, the World Federation maintains its own board of arbitrators, which
 is responsible for settling disputes between two or more bourses themselves;
 and for determining which bourse should hear an arbitration case when the parties
 to it are members of different bourses.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><br>
 Arbitration is a universal, human institution which preceded the monopoly system
 of law embraced by contemporary nation-states. Arbitral anarchy has threatened
 State supremacy because it offers businessmen or others disaffected with the
 State legal system a way of solving their problems without involving the State.
 As Steven Lazarus put it, arbitration offers a &quot;mechanism by which the debilitating
 forces of legalistic sovereignty can be circumvented.&quot; [p.174] Throughout
 history, arbitration has been the hallmark of all customary law systems. The
 practices of the Law Merchant prove beyond doubt &quot;that custom may have the
 force of law, as a means of social discipline, although it does not rest on the
 will of the political sovereign, but on objective standards of reason.&quot;</p>
<p>Arbitration is a purely voluntaryist means of settling societal disputes. In
 an interesting insight on means and ends, Bruce Benson, Murray Rothbard, and
 others have noted that customary law and the private sector must provide the
 underlying foundation of property rights for the free market system. It is impossible
 in the nature of things for a compulsory, monopoly legal system to supply the
 laws required by a totally competitive system. &quot;Politically dictated rules&quot;
 and statutory law are &quot;not designed to support the market system; in fact,
 government-made law is likely to do precisely the opposite.&quot; A coercive,
 non-competitive judicial system simply cannot be made to define property rights
 because it is based upon the supremacy of the political sovereign. In its absence,
 a customary law system based on private property and personal property rights
 would evolve, and arbitration would become one of the major ways of settling
 disputes.</p>
<p>Joseph Jenkins in his article, &quot;The Peacemakers,&quot; highlights the
 importance of arbitration to humankind. He says that &quot;if men are ever to
 realize their potentials, they must master the art of living together peacefully...
 They must devise means of settling their differences by words instead of swords
 or ... warfare... [I]t seems ... that when the concepts of conciliation, mediation,
 and arbitration were introduced into human society, an immense stride was made
 in the problem of enabling people to live peacefully together.&quot; He calls
 arbitrators 'peacemakers' &quot;because they have it within their power to contribute
 more to the maintenance of good relations between conflicting forces in our society
 than any other group,...&quot; Mankind &quot;must be mature enough and wise enough
 to solve their problems without government ... This is the very essence of self-government&quot;
 and voluntaryism. [pp.436 and 467]</p>
