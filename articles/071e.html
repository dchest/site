 <h2>Excerpt from Carroll Quigley's Tragedy and Hope</h2>
 <h3>"When the State Disappeared, Society Continued"</h3>

	Tragedy &amp; Hope <i>uncensored</i></a></h4>

<p>"In the West, the Roman Empire (which continued
in the East as the Byzantine Empire) disappeared
in 476; and, although many efforts were made
to revive it, there was clearly a period, about 900
when there was no empire, no state, and no public
authority in the West. The state disappeared, yet
society continued. So also, religious and economic life
continued. This clearly showed that the state and
society were not the same thing, that society was the
basic entity, and that the state was a crowning, but
not essential, cap to the social structure. This experience had revolutionary effects. It was discovered that man can live without a state;
this became the basis of Western liberalism. It was discovered that the state, if it exists, must
serve men and that it is incorrect to believe that the purpose of men is to serve the state. It was
discovered that economic life, religious life, law, and private property can all exist and function
effectively without a state. From this emerged laissez-faire, separation of Church and State, rule
of law, and the sanctity of private property. In Rome, in Byzantium, and in Russia, law was regarded
as an enactment of a supreme power. In the West, when no supreme power existed, it was discovered
that law still existed as the body of rules which govern social life. Thus law was found by
observation in the West, not enacted by autocracy as in the East. This meant that authority was
established by law and under the law in the West, while authority was established by power and
above the law in the East. The West felt that the rules of economic life were found and not enacted;
that individuals had rights independent of, and even opposed to, public authority; that groups could
exist, as the Church existed, by right and not by privilege, and without the need to have any charter
of incorporation entitling them to exist as a group or act as a group; that groups or individuals
could own property as a right and not as a privilege and that such property could not be taken by
force but must be taken by established process of law. It was emphasized in the West that the way
a thing was done was more important than what was done, while in the East <em>what</em> was done
was far more significant than the way in which it was done."</p>
