 <h2>Flint and Steel: The Memoirs of a Superfluous Spark</h2>
 <h4>by Kevin Cullinane<br>
  From Number 59 - December 1992</h4>
</center>
<p> The other day I received an intellectual newsletter, of the small &quot;l&quot;
 (i.e. traditional) libertarian persuasion, in which the publisher invited subscribers
 to submit occasional columns. The invitation pushed my vanity button; I began
 to daydream: &quot;Yes they say that this year's Nobel selection was first published
 as a guest editorial in a small, libertarian newsletter. Really! How interesting...
 &quot;</p>
<p>Then that silent but baleful, uncompromising pile of half-finished projects
 on my desk pushed my pragmatic button, and the pleasant moment passed. &quot;Besides,&quot;
 the pile seemed to whisper, &quot;You are a bit too vituperative, or sensational
 in style, to appeal to a thoughtful journal.&quot; In self-defense I muttered
 that I wasn't either, I'm a, uh, well .... an iconoclast! I write and lecture
 in an effort to discredit icons which need clasting, and that requires that sparks
 should fly off the paper - but, at heart I'm just a sweet, lovable guy who can't
 get any respect. (The unfinished projects seemed singularly unimpressed.)</p>
<p>Most of us can remember the imagery of a &quot;spark igniting a powder keg&quot;
 somewhere within the stale, dead pages of the state-approved history books, force-fed
 us during adolescence. The hopeful phrase was a five-word promise of something
 exciting about to happen: <strong>KA-BOOM!</strong> (Subliminally, we hoped the
 explosion might actually leap from the pages to shatter the classroom's catatonic
 ambience. - Maybe even blow a hole in the wall through which we could escape
 for the rest of the day!) The anticipation invariably fizzled out; the sterilized
 writers of approved histories having acquired the talent to distill even the
 most dramatic gore into &quot;lite&quot; history. But for a moment the powder-keg
 analogy would have sparked (?) a certain attentive anticipation.</p>
<p>As we all did, I survived the ordeal of state-fed history, &quot;written by
 the winning side.&quot; But my heart was always with those little &quot;sparks&quot;
 which, from time to time shook things up for a page or two of wearying world
 history. Perhaps that attraction was what steered me - during my criminal past
 - into a brief career as a Marine Corps insurgent and counterinsurgent &quot;expert.&quot;
 (it certainly was what attracted me, in more innocent days, to admiration of
 Robin Hood - bane of the sheriffs and bishops surrounding Nottingham Forrest.)</p>
<center><p><b>To Spark Or Not To Spark...</b></p></center>
<p>Any who have ever camped out, beyond reach of propane campstoves, know from
 frustrating experience, that most sparks die without having ignited anything.
 But, is it the job of a spark to succeed, or is its job merely to provide the
 potential for ignition? I've muttered imprecations at sparks for dying on me
 without getting my fire started, and I've sworn at them for igniting unwanted
 brushfires. The poor spark! As with Kipling's generic infantryman, Tommy Atkins,
 it is shot at if it does, and damned if it doesn't.</p>
<p>John Barrington observed that, if a spark (always termed, &quot;treason&quot;
 by the Establishment of its day), manages to touch off a significant reaction,
 it undergoes a certain identity crisis. He wrote:</p>
<center>
<p> &quot;Treason doth never prosper.<br>
 What's the reason?<br>
 For if it doth prosper,<br>
 None dare call it treason.&quot;</p>
</center>
<p>The inflammatory's words, enshrined for a brief season, are referred to as,
 &quot;the sweet light of reason.&quot; Of course, for every Tom Paine who succeeds
 in touching off a sheet-flame of revolutionary passion, a hundred others are
 rounded up by the thought-police or, (even worse!), ignored by one and all during
 their lifetime.</p>
<p>But, as Albert Nock pointed out in his MEMOIRS OF A SUPERFLUOUS MAN, (or was
 it in his essay, &quot;Isaiah's Job&quot;?), trying to second-guess the reception
 which it will receive, is counter-productive to the spark's mission. It is not
 the job of the spark to know where the powder lies, or how much of it there is,
 Nock observed. Nor does the job entail knowing whether the powder is dry enough
 to ignite, or if, having sat overlong in an unfriendly climate, it has become
 degraded into a lump of nitrate fertilizer.</p>
<p>Good point. Any one spark has its brief season, then extinguishes; what it
 accomplishes during its time depends, to important degree, upon the situation
 in which it flares. But then, if the spark were to take the time to carefully
 analyze the situation, before touching its tiny fire to it, the spark would surely
 come to naught. (-rather than only, <em>quite possibly. ... This may be the place
 to observe that, given the unhappy odds facing an iconoclast, it is always well
 for him to have some other form of livelihood than the largess of a grateful
 populace!</em>) In the face of such somber telefinalism, I suppose that it's
 best that I speak and write-away; and let the sparks fall where they may.</p>
<p>There will always be those who counsel a &quot;spoonful of honey,&quot; and
 in most cases they will be correct. The impassive dignity of diplomacy, and dispassionate
 phraseology of academic respectability, almost always impress, even when they
 fail to persuade, or even motivate, don't they? But there remains a place for
 &quot;vinegar&quot; within the intellectual affairs of passionate folks. It could
 be that, at present, the time has passed a point where politically-debased language
 is even capable of communicating genuine freedom consciousness to any significant
 number - but history comforts us that better times will dawn.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is that all-precious Remnant whose unquenchable spirit
 should be fed. &quot;<em>Feed it to them straight</em>&quot; , Nock advised,
 &quot;<em>100-proof, and don't be concerned about those who gag or turn away.</em>&quot;
 So, if there be a journal, here or there, still open to a bit of irreverent and
 rather highly seasoned commentary, perhaps its time to bring the flint and the
 steel together.</p>
