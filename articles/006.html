<h2>The Party Line on a Party Line</h2>
<h4>by Wendy McElroy<br>From Volume 1 Number 6 - August 1983</h4>
</center>
<p><br>
 Individuals act. There is no such thing as a collective will. It is strange to
 have explain this to libertarians. It is disturbing to see how difficult it is
 for some of them to understand an organization which promotes differences of
 approach in an important area, which encourages individuals to think and act
 independently. Where, they insistently ask of The Voluntaryists, <i>is your party
 line on strategy?</i> If this were a request for the statement of principles of Voluntaryism
 - the essential characteristics which distinguish us from other libertarian groups
 - it would be a perfectly reasonable inquiry. And simply answered. We are an
 organization of anarchists with the dual purpose of developing antipolitical
 theory and investigating nonpolitical strategies. Our party line on strategy
 is that it must be consistent with Voluntaryist theory; in short, it must be
 nonpolitical. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the quest for a party line is rarely motivated by a desire for
 information. It is part of a mindset. In this libertarian golden age of hammering
 out the platform and pushing the &quot;pure&quot; party line, many political
 libertarians find it inconceivable that an organization could function without
 words-to-purge by. And the demand for The Voluntaryist party line is not a request
 for the broad principles which tie Voluntaryists together, but for the specific
 positions to which they must conform or be purged as heretical. The reply that
 our position is, in a word, &quot;nonpolitical&quot; is considered to be an evasion.
 <i>Where specifically do The Voluntaryists stand on nonviolent resistance, parallel
 institutions, utopian communities, etc.?</i> Specifically, Voluntaryists stand as
 individuals using their individual judgments concerning the context of a situation
 and what they consider to be be an appropriate strategy given their own weaknesses
 and strengths. </p>
<p>This is not to say that, as editor of The Voluntaryist, I do not have strong
 preferences or that I will give space to any and all nonpolitical approaches.
 Being open minded does not entail abandoning reason or suspending judgment. It
 does entail a commitment to consider any strategy which does not defy commonsense
 - e.g., jumping off a cliff as a grand plan for liberty. I intend to pursue the
 ones I find most promising and I cheerfully grant other Voluntaryists the same
 freedom. </p>
<p>But why this open mindedness? If there is a strategy I prefer, one which I
 think is objectively the most valuable, why not make it the official Voluntaryist
 methodology? There are at least three reasons why an official strategy would
 be a mistake. First, nonpolitical strategy within libertarianism is largely an
 uncharted area which requires far more of a pioneer spirit than a doctrinaire
 censoring. It is necessary to examine a wide range of strategies in the context
 of their histories and their compatibility with anarchist theory. Frankly, it
 is not presently apparent to me whether certain strategies are promising or a
 deadend. </p>
<p>Secondly, although moral questions adhere to strategy - i.e., is the strategy
 peaceful, is it political? - any number of approaches can satisfy these moral
 requirements and be equally valid. Given that a strategy satisfies basic anarchist
 principles, it should be judged solely on pragmatic grounds: how well does it
 address specific goals; how difficult is it to implement; does it have undesirable
 side effects; how well does it embody the personalities and talents of those
 using it? This somewhat contextual view of strategy is at odds with an apriori
 party line on what is acceptable. </p>
<p>Thirdly, even if The Voluntaryists had the arrogance to claim perfect knowledge
 on which strategy best fits any one context, contexts change and strategy must
 be flexible enough to address these shifts in situation. Flexibility and a party
 line are at odds. The Voluntaryist have two goals: the development of antipolitical
 theory; and, the pursuit of nonpolitical means. The &quot;party line&quot; with
 reference to the first goal is that anarchism and the political process are mutually
 destructive and morally inconsistent positions. Here, we are pushing a very specific
 conclusion; to be consistent, anarchists must eschew the political process and
 truly oppose the State. For those who accept this conclusion in theory, no party
 line on strategy is necessary. For those who do not, no party line is possible.
</p>
<p>I applaud all the inventiveness and creativity I find in the area of strategy.
 But, then, I'm an old fashioned libertarian. I still welcome diversity.<br>
