 <h2>Quotes</h2>
 <h4> From Number 71 - December 1994</h4>
</center>
<p>&quot;Again and again in history, we can trace the workings of the law that
 one who has appealed to force must use force to the bitter end, and one who has
 established a reign of terror must intensify terror to frightfulness.&quot;</p>
<p>Stefan Zweig <br>
 THE RIGHT TO HERESY, 1951, p. 340. </p>
<hr>
<center><h4>An Anti-Electorate Manifesto</h4></center>
<p>We, the Anti-Electorate, do not believe there is a need for &quot;strong leadership&quot;
 in government. </p>
<p>We are not drawn to 'intellectual' authorities and political 'heroes.' </p>
<p>We are not impressed with titles, ranks, and pecking orders politicians, celebrities,
 and gurus. </p>
<p>We do not struggle for control of organizations, social circles, and government.
</p>
<p>We do not lobby the State for favors or permission to control those with whom
 we disagree. </p>
<p>Rather, we advocate freedom. </p>
<p>By its very nature, the State does not. </p>
<p>Exercise your right to say 'No' to the warfare-welfare system. </p>
<center>
<p><br>
 Refuse to vote. Then tell your friends. <br>

<hr>
<p>
 &quot;The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude
 ... is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances,
 than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It
 is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break
 a company...a church...a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every
 day regarding, the attitude we will embrace . The only thing we can do is play
 on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life
 is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you; we
 are in charge of our Attitudes.&quot; </p>
