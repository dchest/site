 <h2>The Defacto Bill of Rights</h2>
 <h4>Number 79 - April 1996</h4>
</center>
<p>The Radical Individualist<br>
 Jeffrey Deboo, Editor/Publisher<br>
 1442-A Walnut Street #64<br>
 Berkeley, California 94709</p>
<ol>
<li>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, except
 to mandate explicit reference to the Christian God on the currency; or prohibiting
 the free exercise thereof, aside from oddball cults - whom the Attorney General
 and the FBI may freely smear in the mass media and then wipe off the face of
 the Earth; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, except in the
 case of pornography, hate speech, movies containing excessive violence, or any
 other form of expression which somebody somewhere may find offensive or disquieting.
<li>A well regulated militia of free men being an intolerable menace to the
 totalitarian designs of the State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
 shall apply only to those people employed by the Organs of State Security, and
 of course to muggers, rapists, burglars, gangsters, and other criminals who don't
 obey other laws and can't reasonably be expected to obey this one.
<li>No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house without the
 consent of the owner, since it's much easier to just seize the entire house if
 the Authorities really want it for something (see Amendment 4).
<li>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
 and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be construed
 in such a way as to prevent the Authorities from seizing any property which they
 may believe, infer, suspect, imagine, or assert to be in some way involved with
 anything whatsoever to do with drugs, money laundering, or tax evasion.
<li>No person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in Jeopardy
 of life or limb, except in cases whereby the mass media and public opinion hold
 his acquittal to have been a miscarriage of justice, in which case he may be
 retried on Federal charges as many times as necessary to secure a conviction,
 or in case of parole violation whereby the convicted may be subject to re-incarceration
 as many times as the Authorities deem necessary to ensure rehabilitation; nor
 shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,
 except when the Authorities grant him selective immunity from prosecution to
 force him to do so, then find some legal technicality enabling them to use the
 information thus gained against him anyway.
<li>In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
 and public trial, except where there are interminable delays due to the system
 being clogged with victimless drug cases, and shall be entitled to the assistance
 of counsel for his defense, although the Authorities may seize and confiscate
 any assets, without due process, that he might otherwise use to afford such counsel
 (see Amendment 4).
<li>In suits at common law, where the value at controversy shall exceed twenty
 dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved; however, persons accused
 of rape, child molestation, and other sexual offenses whereby it is generally
 recognized that no one is ever falsely accused, may be tried and summarily found
 guilty by the mass media.
<li>Excessive bail shall be imposed to keep persons who are obviously guilty
 behind bars until the Authorities can get around to trying them, or in such cases
 of suspected parole violation whereby the Authorities, regardless of evidence
 against the accused, may completely deny bail; cruel and unusual punishment shall
 not be inflicted, except as required by both State and Federal mandatory-sentencing
 guidelines.
<li>The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed
 to deny or disparage others retained by the Authorities, including the right
 to control economic activity through taxes and regulation, the right to impose
 mandatory racial and gender favoritism, the right to collect and monitor vast
 amounts of personal data on citizens on the pretext of the Census, the right
 to arbitrarily bar citizens from visiting certain foreign countries, and other
 rights which it may occur to the Authorities to decide they currently have.
<li>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
 prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to
 the people; however, any State which attempts to enforce this provision by seceding
 from the Union in the face of flagrant violation of its sovereignty by the Federal
 Authorities shall be subject to invasion, militarily occupied , and razed to
 the ground at the discretion of the President, while any lesser attempt by any
 State to assert its rights under this Amendment shall be punished by occupation
 by the National Guard, withholding of Federal Funds, or other means at the disposal
 of the Federal Government.
