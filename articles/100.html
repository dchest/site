 <h2>Why I Refuse to Register (To Vote or Pay Taxes)</h2>
 <h4>by Anonymous<br>
  Number 100 - Oct 1999</h4>
</center>
<p> To the Editor of <em>The Voluntaryist</em>, I am anonymously sending this
 letter to you after looking at <em>The Voluntaryist</em> website while surfing
 the internet. It appears that my ideas might fit somehow with what you call voluntaryism.</p>
<p>I am one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't file tax returns or
 voluntarily pay taxes. I'm writing this letter to explain something that you
 and your readers may not be aware of. The reasons for not filing tax returns
 or voluntarily paying taxes, and not voting, are similar.</p>
<p>They are similar in that both taxes and voting are activities that demand involvement
 with that coercive institution known as government. Government exercises a monopoly
 of legal control over a certain geographic area. This encompasses coercive monopolization
 of the major services that it provides us. To fund these services, the government
 unilaterally imposes a compulsory levy upon us. These &quot;taxes&quot; are not
 based on the amount of service the government provides us, nor upon our request
 for them. (The government does not offer us the opportunity to do without a particular
 service, or shop elsewhere for it, or to negotiate the price.) It doesn't care
 if we didn't want the service, didn't use all that was offered, or simply refused
 it altogether. The government declares it a crime if we refuse to pay all or
 part of &quot;our share.&quot; It attempts to punish this refusal by making us
 serve time in jail or confiscating some of our property, or both.</p>
<p>The main reason, however, why I refuse to pay taxes is that I don't want to
 give my sanction to the government. I, for one, do not consent to our particular
 government, nor do I want to support any coercive institution. I object, on principle,
 to the forced collection of taxes because taxes are a euphemism for stealing.
 (By stealing, I mean taking another person's property without his voluntary consent.)
 Stealing is not an activity that leads to social harmony or prosperity. Stealing
 is anti-life. It is not an activity that can be universalized. If it were, it
 would result in death and destruction for all. Furthermore, &quot;stealing&quot;
 or &quot;taxation&quot; is wasteful. Everyone agrees that government money is
 spent unwisely, wastefully, and on at least some project(s) which would not be
 voluntarily supported by some taxpayers. But, even if the spending were not wasteful
 or for some improper purpose, I would still object strenuously because taxes
 are theft. In other words, I object to the means (the compulsion used by government)
 - regardless of how efficiently the money is spent or what it is spent on. I
 do not want it said about me that I cooperated with the government.</p>
<p>Similarly, I refuse to participate in the electoral process (I simply refuse
 to register to vote) because I do not want it ever said that I supported the
 state. When you play a game, you agree to abide by the rules and accept the outcome.
 Well, I simply refuse to play, and in clear conscience can say that I am not
 bound by the outcome. Furthermore, there [are] many reprehensible activities
 taken by the government (you choose your own example) which I do not wish to
 support. Governments need legitimacy, and one of the major means of establishing
 legitimacy is to claim that the voters support the government. Just imagine if
 everyone refused to vote and pay taxes. Government would shrivel up. But, before
 that happened legislators at every level would probably pass laws that would
 make voting compulsory. This has already happened in some countries.</p>
<p>I recently read an article by Charles Reich (from his column, &quot;Reflections,&quot;
 on &quot;The Limits of Duty&quot;) that appeared in the June 19, 1971 issue of
 <em>The New Yorker</em>. It was written during the Vietnam era, when many draft-age
 college students were resisting conscription into the United States military
 forces. Reich wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Perhaps the best way to understand those who have resisted the draft - by
 seeking conscientious-objector status, by going to jail, by fleeing to Canada
 - is to acknowledge that they are demanding to live and to be judged by the old
 standards as fully responsible moral beings. They are seeking law, not evading
 it. Finding no acceptable standard of conduct available in today's organizational
 society, they have gone to standards that are not their own personal fiat but
 the old, traditional standards of religion, ethics, and common law. They are
 saying that they refuse to act in a way that common experience tells them will
 produce evil - evil that we know about or should know about. (emphasis added,
 p.55) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, in refusing to &quot;register&quot; to pay taxes, I am going
 back to &quot;the old, traditional standards of religion, ethics, common law,&quot;
 and common sense. I am refusing to act in a way that produces or contributes
 to evil. I rest my case. </p>
