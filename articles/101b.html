 <h2>&quot;The Illusion Is Liberty - The Reality Is Leviathan&quot;:<br>
  A Voluntaryist Perspective on the Bill of Rights</h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  Number 101 - Dec 1999</h4>
</center>
<p> Delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia began their deliberations
 on May 25, 1787. During the hot summer months when their arguments seemed to
 extend interminably, Benjamin Franklin observed that life went on around them
 despite their debates. At one point, he &quot;is said to have warned the delegates:
 'Gentlemen, you see that in the anarchy in which we live society manages much
 as before. Take care, if our disputes last too long, that the people do not come
 to think they can very easily do without us'.&quot; (1) While this story may
 be apocryphal, James Iredell, another delegate, noted that if the confederation
 continued as it was, it might as well &quot;resolve into total anarchy at once,
 of which indeed our present condition falls very little short.&quot; (2) These
 introductory remarks demonstrate that the federalist supporters of the Constitution
 were highly perceptive politicians and strategists. They realized that if they
 fumbled too long, their efforts at structuring a new government would fail and
 they would not attain the legitimacy which their new political enterprise required.</p>
<p>This article was sparked by an essay written by Forrest McDonald entitled &quot;The
 Bill of Rights: Unnecessary and Pernicious,&quot; in which he presents the thesis
 (which he shares with some other historians) that the first ten amendments to
 the federal Constitution were essentially a legitimizing device used by those
 favoring a strong central government. In other words, many Americans who otherwise
 might not have supported the new central government were won over to it by the
 adoption of the Bill of Rights. Reading McDonald's article led me to review some
 of the history of the adoption of the Bill of Rights, of the conflict between
 the Federalists and their opponents, the Anti-Federalists, of the strategy adopted
 by the Federalists in urging the ratification of the Constitution, and to consider
 the ultimate significance of the Bill of Rights. Would we, as late 20th Century
 Americans, have been better or worse off had the Bill of Rights never been adopted?
 What would American constitutional history look like if there had been no Bill
 of Rights? The purpose of this article is to examine these topics from a voluntaryist
 perspective, and to decide what position the committed voluntaryist would have
 taken during the struggle for the ratification of the Constitution and the adoption
 of the first ten amendments.</p>
<p>In order to understand the place of these amendments in American history, it
 is first necessary to comprehend the voluntaryist view of the Declaration of
 Independence and Revolutionary War. (3) Despite the seemingly libertarian nature
 of the revolution, even the Declaration of Independence was a statist document.
 For example, it concluded with the statement that the representatives of the
 United States of America do declare &quot;That these United Colonies are, and
 of Right, ought to be Free and Independent States; ... and that as Free and Independent
 States, they have full power to levy War; conclude Peace, contract Alliances,
 establish commerce and to do all the other Acts and Things which independent
 States may of right do.&quot; In other words, the signers of the Declaration
 intended to create a new State to replace the one they were &quot;throwing off.&quot;
 As Albert Jay Nock observed, there was great dissension about the form of the
 political institutions which came after the Americans won the war, &quot;but
 [there] was none about its nature. ... Dissatisfaction was directed against administrators,
 not against the institution itself.&quot; Those who fought and led the rebellion
 against Great Britain meant to have a State of their own to control, not one
 under the control of a far away British Parliament and monarch. The bottom line,
 after all is said and done, is that colonial-era Americans, after having won
 the battle against Britain, simply swapped one State for another.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the first American central government, The Articles of Confederation
 and Perpetual Union, was relatively weak because &quot;most men of the Revolutionary
 period took it for granted that it was the nature of all governments to seek
 to acquire more power. ... [Their attitude was that] all power corrupts and all
 power tends to become absolute.&quot; (4) Hence, they were jealous of political
 power. Many on the frontier were independent and self-reliant to the point of
 being nearly ungovernable. They &quot;were improvident and anti-social; they
 did not take kindly to any form of authority which inevitably to them meant order,
 limitations on freedom of action, mutual obligations, and, worst of all taxes.
 ... Generally speaking and aside from statesmen, merchants, and the veterans
 of the Revolution, the idea of a National Government had not [yet] penetrated
 the minds of the people. They managed to tolerate State Governments, because
 they had always lived under some such thing; but a National Government was too
 far away and fearsome, too alien and forbidding for them to view it with friendliness
 or understanding.&quot; (5)</p>
<p>The Confederation, agreed upon by the Second Continental Congress on November
 15, 1777 became effective in 1781. It was based upon an alliance of the thirteen
 newly independent states. The central government they created had no power to
 tax, field soldiers, regulate commerce, or even enforce its own laws.Whatever
 revenue it raised was done by assessing the legislatures of the individual states,
 who then, in whatever form they wished, levied upon their citizenry. It was an
 intolerable situation for any government, much less a national one. Consequently,
 American political leaders realized that they must assume control over the financial
 and military aspects of the country in order to truly govern. They required sufficient
 money and soldiers to protect the new nation from foreign aggressors, criminals,
 and recalcitrant states or taxpayers. In order to accomplish these goals, they
 crafted a new document, known as the Constitution of the United States, which
 was distributed to the various state governments for their approval in September
 1787.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Convention was originally called to amend the Articles,
 not supersede or annul them. Under the Articles of Confederation, the states
 were pledged to a perpetual union, and no provision had been made for dissolving
 their association - except that any changes in the Confederation had to be done
 by the unanimous agreement of all the States. Thus, there are only two ways to
 view the Constitutional Convention. Either the individual States had the right
 to secede (without the agreement of the other States) or else the Founding Fathers
 instigated a revolution to change the governing institutions of the country.
 In the latter case, they &quot;assumed constituent powers, ordained a new constitution,
 and demanded a plebiscite thereon over the head of all existing legally organized
 powers. Had Julius [Caesar] or Napoleon committed these acts, they would have
 been pronounced a coup d'etat.&quot; (6) The fact that the Articles of Confederation
 were still the fundamental law of the thirteen states was simply ignored by the
 members of the Constitutional Convention.</p>
<p>Although the States never seem to have formally withdrawn their consent to
 the Articles, in each State a special ratifying convention was held to approve
 or reject the Constitution. In Rhode Island, the first ratifying convention rejected
 the Constitution. It was during the struggle for the ratification (September
 1787 to June 1788, when the new constitution actually went into effect in the
 first nine ratifying states) that the first political parties in American took
 shape. Despite the chasm between Federalists and Anti-Federalists, one very important
 point is usually overlooked. Both were supportive and approved of some sort of
 central statist authority over the thirteen states. All assumed that some sort
 of government was necessary to protect man's rights. As Herbert Storing in THE
 COMPLETE ANTI-FEDERALIST put it, &quot;If the Federalists and Anti-Federalists
 were divided among themselves, they were, at a deeper level, united with one
 another.&quot; They all &quot;agreed that the purpose of government is the regulation
 and thereby the protection of individual rights and that the best instrument
 for this purpose is some form of limited republican government.&quot; (7) The
 Federalists and Anti-Federalists were not arguing about whether there should
 be a government to rule men - but rather what form that government should take.</p>
<p>Many historians have often seen the Anti-Federalists as libertarian opponents
 of the newly proposed federal Constitution. This, however, is a mistake. Alexander
 Hamilton pointed out that the Anti-Federalists were really trying hard to reconcile
 the contradiction of &quot;limited government.&quot; (8) How could a coercive
 organization that retained a monopoly on the use of violence be kept in check?
 The Anti-Federalists recognized that such a monopoly carried with it the potential
 for unbounded tyranny. Many features of the new Constitution frightened them:
 A lifetime judiciary &quot;removed from the people might 'enforce harsh and arbitrary
 laws'.&quot; In the combined role of the President as commander-in-chief and
 chief executive officer of the government they saw the powers of a military dictator.
 They were also skeptical about how a government might be kept limited if Congress
 could pass any laws &quot;necessary and proper&quot; to carry out its enumerated
 powers.</p>
<p>One commentator has claimed that the Anti-Federalists &quot;thought the goal
 of the American Revolution was to end the ancient equation of power where arrogant,
 oppressive, and depraved rulers on one side produced subservience and a gradual
 erosion of self-respect, capacities, and virtue of the people on the other side.
 The result was an increasing corruption and degeneracy in both rulers and ruled.
 Unless this cycle could be broken, [the Anti-Federalists thought] independence
 would mean little more than the exchange of one tyranny for another. The intense
 Anti-Federalist suspicion of corruption, greed, and lust for power&quot; was
 not without merit, but not one of them recognized the error of the Federalist
 claim that &quot;the true principle of the American Revolution was not hostility
 to government, but hostility to tyrannical government.&quot; In fact, that was
 their error: they objected to tyrannical government, believing that some form
 of government might not be tyrannical. In this they were wrong. History has not
 only sustained the Anti-Federalists in their claims that &quot;corruption and
 tyranny would be rampant ... when those who exercised power felt little connection
 with the people,&quot; but has also shown that all government, by its very nature,
 is tyrannical. (9)</p>
<p>The inconsistent and unprincipled attitude of most Anti-Federalists shows how
 they were manipulated into supporting the Constitution. At first, they argued
 that the Articles of Confederation were preferable to the newly proposed Constitution,
 but as more and more state ratifying conventions approved the Constitution, they
 began to realize that they had better cut their losses. They began calling for
 amendments in order to safeguard and protect the rights of individual citizens,
 as well as to reserve the unenumerated powers of governing to the individual
 State governments. Furthermore, if the Anti-Federalists had a strategy for opposing
 the Constitution it was flawed from the beginning. Instead of objecting to the
 legal irregularities of the Philadelphia convention and boycotting the proceedings,
 some of the Anti-Federalists participated in the convention and had a direct
 role in creating the compromises incorporated into the new Constitution. By arguing
 against specific details of the Constitution, they gave it a legitimacy which
 it otherwise could not have obtained. If they were opposed on principle to the
 new Constitution, they should have stated their opposition to it and refused
 to debate the details. By participating in the debates over ratification in the
 States, the Anti-Federalists implied that they were willing to accept the decision
 of the special conventions called together in each State to decide whether or
 not that State would accept the Constitution. How could the Anti-Federalists
 reject the vote of the majority of delegates to special ratification conventions
 if they participated in the political campaigns that led to the selection of
 those delegates?</p>
<p>Initially, the Federalists had a clear-cut goal. Their objective was to get
 the new Constitution ratified by the conventions in nine States as quickly as
 possible. Otherwise, they would be in danger of losing their new Constitution
 altogether. &quot;The Federalists were determined that Americans not be diverted
 ... from the main task of providing themselves with effective government. ...
 The main political business of the American people ... was ... not to protect
 themselves against political power, but to accept the responsibility of governing
 themselves. The Federalists did not deny that government, once established, may
 need protecting against, but they tried to make&quot; that a secondary consideration.
 (10) Thus in June 1788, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the
 Constitution, both the Federalists and Anti-Federalists underwent a sudden change
 of strategies. The Anti-Federalists began campaigning for a new constitutional
 convention, which was permissible under Article V of the newly adopted Constitution.
 They hoped that they would have the required political clout to change some of
 the objectionable features of the new Constitution. On the other hand, many of
 the Federalists who had hitherto resisted supporting a call for any constitutional
 amendments, changed their tune. James Madison became the leader of those advocating
 the incorporation of a bill of rights into the new Constitution. In June 1789,
 he proposed twelve amendments to the Constitution, ten of which were adopted
 in 1791 and which later became known as the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Originally, most of the Federalists had been opposed to any bill of rights.
 Alexander Hamilton, for example, pointed out that there was no reason to limit
 the powers of the federal government in areas where it was not constitutionally
 granted any powers. Nevertheless, Madison believed, and rightfully so, that his
 suggested amendments would help keep the Constitution intact and protect it from
 destruction by the Anti-Federalists. His objective, as he said in his speech
 of June 8, 1789, was &quot;to give satisfaction to the doubting part of our fellow-citizens.&quot;
 (11) His proposal for a bill of rights was designed to forestall a call for a
 new constitutional convention and to counter the efforts of the Anti-Federalists
 to revise the powers and basic structure of the new government. His hope was
 to save the constitution &quot;by pushing forward a set of amendments that almost
 everyone could accept and that excluded all the Anti-Federalists' [radical and]
 fundamental proposals.&quot; (12) The most significant of these had been the
 suggestion from several of the States that direct taxes and excises not be collected
 in any State raising its own quota of money for the federal government.</p>
<p>Madison purposefully crafted his proposals to quickly help legitimize the new
 government. He avoided statements detailing perpetual standards or maxims &quot;to
 which a people might rally&quot; because he realized &quot;that they tended to
 undermine stable and effective government.&quot; Since the new federal government
 needed (and in his opinion deserved) a presumption of legitimacy and permanency,
 it would have been foolish of him to include any reference to first principles
 that would have undermined that presumption. For this reason, Madison limited
 his proposals to &quot;specific protections of traditional civil rights&quot;
 rather than embrace a statement of first principles like those found in the Declaration
 of Independence or the Virginia Bill of Rights. Congress showed that it understood
 this need for legitimacy when on September 25, 1789 it submitted the completed
 constitutional amendments to the States and noted that &quot;their acceptance
 would extend 'the ground of public confidence in the government'.&quot; (13)</p>
<p>Madison's amendments were simply window dressing for public consumption. First
 of all,they did not curtail any of the substantive powers of the central or state
 governments. Secondly, they had little legal or constitutional significance because
 many of the critical rights of Americans were already respected without a bill
 of rights. (14) A few like the prohibition on &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws
 had originally been included in the Constitution. (Indeed, some had questioned
 the propriety of the prohibition's inclusion there arguing that &quot;there was
 no lawyer, no civilian who would not say that 'ex post facto' laws were void
 in [and of] themselves. It cannot be necessary to prohibit them.&quot; (15) Others,
 like the presumption of innocence, were considered so basic and self-evident
 that they never required constitutional recognition. Under the English common
 law &quot;basic, natural, and fundamental individual rights were protected whether
 enumerated specifically in the Constitution or not.&quot; (16) Consequently,
 the personal security of those living under the common law at that time did not
 &quot;really depend upon or originate in any general proposition contained in
 any written document.&quot; The enactment of constitutions or bills of rights
 or parliamentary statutes were &quot;records of the existence of a right&quot;
 rather &quot;than statutes which conferred it.&quot; Freedom for Americans at
 the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights grew out of custom and tradition,
 not written law. (17)</p>
<p>As several observers have pointed out, it would be interesting to speculate
 how our constitutional liberties would have evolved without a Bill of Rights
 or what would have occurred had the amendments not been set off by themselves
 at the end of the Constitution. (Madison originally opted for their insertion
 at various places within the document.) Hadley Arkes, in his essay &quot;On The
 Danger Of A Bill Of Rights&quot; comments that justification for interference
 with personal liberties would still have to be made whether or not a particular
 liberty was embraced in the Bill Of Rights. (18) Herbert Storing wrote that &quot;Without
 a Bill Of Rights our courts would probably have developed a kind of common law
 of individual rights to help test and limit governmental power.&quot; (19) What
 we do know, for sure, is that several violations of individual rights were and
 still are found right in the Bill of Rights. For example, according to the Third
 Amendment, soldiers may be quartered in private homes during war time without
 the homeowners consent. (As one commentator noted, the government has bypassed
 even this requirement &quot;by simply removing the citizens from their houses
 and conscripting them into the army, navy, and air force.&quot;) (20) By the
 Fourth Amendment, the government may conduct searches and seizures so long as
 they are of a reasonable nature. The wording of the Fifth Amendment implies that
 people may be deprived of their property so long as such confiscation is countenanced
 by due process of law. Private property may be taken for public purposes so long
 as just compensation is paid by the government. The Seventh Amendment, which
 provides for jury trials in civil suits, also provides that &quot;no fact tried
 by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined by any Court of the United States, than
 according to the rules of the common law.&quot; &quot;By implication, limiting
 the exemption to a reexamination of facts effectively confirmed the power of
 appellate courts to overturn jury findings in matters of law.&quot; (21) Thus
 it was that juries lost the final say in matters of law.</p>
<p>Forrest McDonald in his essay mentioned at the beginning of this article labeled
 the Bill of Rights as &quot;Unnecessary and Pernicious.&quot; They were unnecessary
 because most of them were already embraced by the common law. They were pernicious
 because they helped legitimize the Constitution in the minds of the American
 people. Furthermore, McDonald points out that &quot;The Bill of Rights has never
 been an especially effective guarantor of rights.&quot; (22) &quot;One by one,
 the provisions ... [of the Constitution] have been eaten away, and nobody seems
 to have noticed or cared. The illusion is liberty. The reality is Leviathan.&quot;
 (23) Whenever the government's revenues have been threatened, whenever the nation
 has been gripped by some sort of national emergency, or by a major war, the Bill
 of Rights and other provisions of the Constitution have usually been laid aside.
 One need only mention Lincoln's violation of civil liberties during the Civil
 War, the Legal Tender and Gold Cases, the Red Scare during World War I, the internment
 of Japanese-Americans during World War II, and the imprisonment of tax resisters
 during this century to see how little protection the Bill of Rights has offered
 Americans.</p>
<p>Many nations have been brutally tyrannized by governments that ruled according
 to constitutions, but the question about government is not really whether it
 is tyrannical. The question is: Should there be a state, however weak or strong
 it might be? A man who is a slave asks: by what right is he enslaved, not whether
 he has a good or kind master. All governments and all slavemasters are unjust.
 The weakest or strongest of governments must necessarily make the same claims
 and both attempt to exercise a monopoly of power within their borders. They must
 both have exclusive possession of and control over the military and the police.
 They must both demand the right to declare war and peace, conscript life, and
 expropriate income and property, levy taxes, and regulate daily life. The main
 point is, as Robert Nisbet has so ably put it in his essay, &quot;The State&quot;:
 &quot;With all respect to differences among types of government, there is not,
 in strict theory, any difference between the powers available to the democratic
 and the totalitarian State. We may pride ourselves in the democracies on Bills
 or other expressions of individual rights against the State, but in fact they
 are rights against a given government and can be obliterated or sharply diminished
 when it is deemed necessary.&quot; (24) Constitutions and bills of rights are
 legitimizing tools of the ruling elite. Both are badges of slavery not liberty,
 and should be rejected. It is only when people awaken to these facts that they
 will become free.</p>
