 <h2>Chaos In The Air: Voluntaryism or Statism in the Early Radio Industry?</h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  From Number 51 - August 1991</h4>
</center>
<h4>Historical Overview</h4>
<p> In the history of technology in the 20th Century, one of the most rapidly
 developed and marketed scientific advances was the radio, or the wireless, as
 it was originally called. Invented by Guglielmo Marconi in the late 1890s, the
 commercial value of wireless telegraphy was at first believed to be in the transmission
 of Morse code in ship-to-shore communications. Government intervention from the
 very beginning influenced how the wireless evolved. In the United States, the
 laws regulating the radio industry eventually became some of the most severe,
 the most drastic, and most confining of those affecting any American business.
 nevertheless, the history of the radio industry is an interesting example of
 voluntaryism at work. Never in his wildest dreams did Marconi imagine the development
 of commercial voice radio broadcasting as it emerged in the United States by
 1930, with hundreds of stations transmitting into millions of homes. Nor did
 Marconi or others understand the homesteading process by which the free market
 was developing property rights (freedom from interference) in the radio spectrum.
 Whatever progress was being made in this direction was destroyed by federal legislation
 in the late 1920s. &quot;Chaos in the air,&quot; an expression some historians
 have used to label the early phases of the radio industry, was really the result
 of statism, not voluntaryism.</p>
<h4>The Invention Of The Wireless And Its Early Development</h4>
<p> Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937) was the Italian inventor- entrepreneur who came
 to England in 1896, and took out the world's first (British) patent for wireless
 telegraphy based on the use of electric waves. A year later, he and his relatives
 formed the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company. From the very start of his
 experiments in England, Marconi recognized the commercial and military value
 of his invention. He provided wireless demonstrations to officials of the British
 Post Office, and other countries. By 1898, he had established communication between
 England and France across the English Channel, utilized wireless in naval maneuvers,
 and seen the first military application of his invention in the Boer War.</p>
<p> In order to commercially exploit his invention, at the turn of the century
 Marconi formed a subsidiary company, called Marconi International Communications,
 which leased trained operators and equipment, rather than charging for individual
 messages which those operators transmitted. Not charging for messages allowed
 Marconi to circumvent telegraph monopoly restrictions of the British Post Office
 that &quot;prohibited a private company from sending telegraphic messages for
 monetary gain.&quot; In 1901, he signed an exclusive 14 year contract with Lloyd's
 of London. Marconi operators and Marconi equipment were used by Lloyd's to keep
 the home office advised about the status of insured ships. Thus Marconi established
 a presence in all the major seaports of the world. Meanwhile, since competitors
 from America and Germany had appeared, the Marconi Company established its most
 controversial policy, known as the nonintercommunication rule. Marconi operators
 on ship or shore, could only communicate with other Marconi operators. Clients
 using other apparatus were excluded from the Marconi network. Only in the event
 of a serious emergency was this rule to be suspended.</p>
<p> The nonintercommunication rule was the only way Marconi could benefit from
 his efforts, given the British Postal regulations that prevented him from sending
 messages for profit. Nonetheless, when put into practice, it was to have serious
 international repercussions. In March 1902, Prince Henry of Germany, the Kaiser's
 brother, was returning to Germany after a highly publicized visit to the United
 States. He was sailing aboard a German liner, the &quot;Deutschland&quot;, which
 was equipped with wireless equipment made by a German company, Slaby-Arco. None
 of the Marconi stations on either side of the Atlantic would communicate with
 the ship because of its rival apparatus. Prince Henry, who tried to send wireless
 messages to both the US and Germany, was outraged. The ship might as well not
 have had any wireless equipment on board.</p>
<p> This was just the beginning of &quot;malignant Marconiphobia&quot; on the
 part of the Germans. In July 1903, a month before the first international wireless
 conference in Berlin, two competing German firms, Slaby-Arco and Braun-Siemens-Halske,
 merged to form Telefunken in order to present a united German front against Marconi.
 This was done with the full support of the German government. Although the Conference
 was supposed to address a number of wide-ranging issues, the only real issue
 was the Marconi Company's refusal to communicate with other systems. All the
 countries at the conference, with the exception of Italy and Great Britain, favored
 compelling Marconi to communicate with all ships because they opposed his 'de
 facto' monopolization of the air waves.</p>
<p> &quot;Although the 'Deutschland' incident appeared at first to be a petty
 confrontation between two rival companies and their respective countries, it
 was actually a watershed in the early history of wireless. The emerging problems
 surrounding the technology and its financing and regulation, and the sanctity
 of each country's territorial air were embodied in the Marconi German clash.
 Could a private company, whether it had technical priority or not, gain dominance
 over a resource such as the airwaves and become arbiter of who could use them
 and who could not?&quot; Most of the European countries represented at the Conference
 (Germany, France, Spain, and Austria) had all assumed control of wireless in
 their own countries-under the guise of its military significance. Whereas Marconi
 was involved in commercial exploitation, the governments of these countries saw
 huge strategic value in the airwaves. The American delegates were at a loss since
 their own government had done so little &quot;to promote or gain jurisdiction
 over the American wireless situation.&quot;</p>
<h4>The U.S. Government And Other International Regulation</h4>
<p> It was not until a year after the conference that the United States government
 took concerted action to address itself to the benefits of wireless. On June
 26, 1904 Teddy Roosevelt appointed the Interdepartmental Board of Wireless Telegraphy,
 better known as the Roosevelt Board. Its purpose was to report on the consolidation
 and management of wireless for the government. The board was also to determine
 how private and government stations could operate without interference. The board
 submitted their report in August 1904. It suggested that the Navy take responsibility
 for operating the government's wireless system and begin establishing a complete
 country-wide radio telegraphy system. The Navy was to receive and send messages
 free of charge, except it was not to compete with commercial stations. It also
 recommended licensing of all private stations and supervision of them by the
 Department of Commerce and labor to prevent &quot;exploitation&quot; and &quot;control
 by monopolies and trust.&quot;</p>
<p> The Navy's attitude was best explained by its attitude toward monopoly. The
 naval officers on the Roosevelt Board were not opposed to monopoly, per se, for
 they favored naval control of wireless. They simply opposed civilian or commercial
 monopoly which would take control out of their hands.</p>
<p> The U.S. Navy displayed a cavalier attitude towards wireless from the very
 first. American inventors, such as John Stone, Reginald Fessenden, and Lee De
 Forest, had formed their own companies to compete against Marconi, and produce
 their own wireless apparatus. All of them encountered a naval attitude that was
 &quot;inhospitable to inventors, and unappreciative of their technical goals
 and financial needs.&quot; In August 1904, when the Navy scheduled its first
 wireless trials, it set impossible requirements, such as requiring guarantees
 that apparatus built by one company would communicate with another. After inspecting
 the equipment supplied by various companies, the Navy refused to respect their
 patents. In the case of Reginald Fessenden, he advised the Navy in late 1904,
 that they were infringing on his patent for the electrolytic detector. The Navy
 considered itself under no obligation to respect his patent, even after Fessenden
 won numerous court decisions in his favor. Ultimately he had to obtain an injunction
 and a contempt of court citation to prevent one of his competitors from supplying
 the Navy with pirated copies of his apparatus.</p>
<p> In October 1906, the second International Wireless Conference took place in
 Berlin. The second conference was again called by Germany, because nothing had
 been solved by the first conference. Twenty-seven countries sent delegates. Again,
 as at the first conference, the nonintercommunication policy of the Marconi Company
 was the primary issue. The American delegates introduced a resolution endorsing
 compulsory intercommunication, whether it be ship-to-ship, or ship-to-shore.
 All but the delegates of Britain, Italy, and Japan accepted these resolutions.
 The compromise that emerged from the conference required every public shore station
 to communicate with every wireless-equipped ship, and vice versa, without regard
 to the system of wireless telegraphy used by either. With this major issue out
 of the way, both the German and American delegates went on to tackle other issues
 which would bolster military control. &quot;To that end they supported the revolutionary
 German proposal that the ether be divided into regions by wave lengths, with
 the military getting the largest and best tracts.&quot; The Germans recommended
 a range of 600 to 1600 meters for naval and governmental use, and 300 to 600
 meters for commercial stations and merchant ships. In Germany, where all the
 stations were government-owned and -operated, this division made no real difference.
 But in England and America where all the stations were private, except for a
 few naval stations, this would impose a great hardship on Marconi by relegating
 all private stations, to an inferior portion of the spectrum. This proposal was
 supported by the American delegates, &quot;hoping it would ease the U.S. Navy
 into a preeminent position in American Wireless: the Navy hoped to gain through
 regulation what it had failed to achieve technically.&quot;</p>
<p> Other regulations were worked out at the conference. All shipboard stations
 were to be licensed by the country under whose flag they sailed. Shipboard operators
 were also to be licensed. It was at this conference that the international distress
 code was decided upon. Britain preferred its own CQ (supposedly from 'seek you'),
 but the Germans insisted on their SOE. Since the letter 'e' was only one dot
 and could get easily lost, it was decided to use SOS. When Great Britain ratified
 the treaty in 1908, Parliament agreed to compensate the Marconi Company through
 a three year subsidy, that would make up for any loss it would suffer as a result
 of the abridgement of its nonintercommunication policy.</p>
<h4>Developments In American Radio</h4>
<p> When the American delegates to the second International Wireless Conference
 returned home, they were surprised that public sentiment was against ratification
 of the treaty. By late 1906, numerous developments, unique to the American radio
 scene had taken place. For one thing, American wireless activity had not been
 confined to the military or to business. The ubiquitous amateur had appeared,
 prompted by the discovery of the crystal detector which made possible a sensitive,
 durable, and inexpensive receiving apparatus. The father of science fiction and
 an avid promoter of wireless as a hobby, Hugo Gernsback had already opened his
 radio emporium, Electro-Importing Company, in New York City, for the amateur.
 His shop was the first in the United States to sell wireless apparatus appropriate
 for home use directly to the public. By 1910, the amateurs surpassed both the
 US Navy and United Wireless (the largest private wireless company) in both quantity
 of operators, and usually in the quality of apparatus. The Wireless Association
 of America, which Hugo Gernsback had also started, claimed ten thousand members
 by 1910, and the NEW YORK TIMES estimated that 122 wireless clubs existed in
 America by 1912.</p>
<p> Another development, to have more impact in the future, was that Reginald
 Fessenden had reported the first successful voice transmission by wireless in
 October 1906. At the same time, Lee De Forest announced the invention of his
 new receiver, the audion, an early version of the radio vacuum tube. Both of
 these inventors foresaw the possibilities of radiotelephony (wireless voice transmission),
 not only for point-to-point messages, but for broadcasting speech and music.
 This conception of radio was &quot;original, revolutionary, and quite different.&quot;
 Instead of offering institutional customers a substitute system similar to one
 they already had, De Forest (in particular) was suggesting a new technical and
 entertainment system to be marketed to ordinary people. De Forest envisioned
 using wireless telephony as a means of making money for himself by delivering
 entertainment to people in their homes. His idea was buttressed by the occurrence
 of the first true radio broadcast in American history, which took place on Christmas
 Eve, 1906. This was done by a competitor, Reginald Fessenden, and the program
 included music from phonograph records, live violin music, singing and live speech.
 A similar program was repeated on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p> The collision of two ships, the REPUBLIC and the FLORIDA, in January 1909,
 precipitated the first government regulation of wireless in America. The two
 ships, carrying over 1200 passengers, rammed one another 26 miles south of Nantucket.
 Two people were killed, and hundreds injured, but the remainder were saved as
 a result of the efforts of Jack Binns, wireless operator on the REPUBLIC, who
 transmitted SOS messages until a rescue ship arrived. Realizing that the wireless
 provided a safety net to ships at sea, Congress passed the Wireless Ship Act
 on June 24, 1910. &quot;It provided that any ocean-going steamer sailing in or
 out of United States ports, carrying fifty or more persons, and plying between
 ports two hundred miles or more apart, be equipped with 'efficient apparatus
 for radio-communication, in good working order, in charge of a person skilled
 in the use of such apparatus'.&quot;</p>
<p> By l9lO, wireless had existed in America for a decade.The US Congress had
 not ratified either of the international treaties of 1903 or 1906, and the commercial
 companies had lobbied against any type of regulation whatsoever. The increased
 use of the air waves led to a three-way struggle between the amateur radio enthusiasts,
 the U.S. Navy (representing the American military establishment) and the commercial
 business interests. As radio was uncharted ground (and at this point in time
 not yet regulated domestically by the federal government) there were no guidelines
 for doing away with interference or establishing priority to portions of the
 airwaves. The commercial companies were loath to take this dispute into the public
 arena for fear of suggesting that wireless was still unreliable and needed public
 regulation. If the commercial companies could not overpower their competitors,
 they resorted to gentlemen's agreements among themselves. &quot;For example,
 the one hundred members of a wireless club in Chicago worked out an air-sharing
 agreement with the local commercial operators which was designed to reduce interference
 for both groups.&quot;</p>
<p> Military officials began lobbying in Washington, as early as 1909, for stricter
 regulations or elimination of the amateur on the grounds of safety at sea and
 national security. Amateur interference with Navy ships at sea, as well as base
 naval stations rankled the Navy to no end. The amateurs issued charges of their
 own against the Navy: that many naval operators were incompetent and that the
 Navy used antiquated equipment. The amateurs were not willing to accept the national
 security argument when the Navy itself had done little to &quot;ensure that wireless
 would help preserve that security.&quot; According to the amateurs the Navy should
 have to clean up its own act before it called for restricting the amateurs. In
 short, the amateurs took a &quot;proprietary attitude toward the airwaves they
 had been working in for the past five years.&quot; The Wireless Ship Act of 1910,
 which had gone into effect in July 1911, ultimately worsened radio interference,
 especially at port, because more and more ships were equipped with radio apparatus.
 By 1912, numerous bills had been introduced in Congress to diminish pollution
 of the ether, as radio interference was called, though none were passed.</p>
<h4>The Radio Act of 1912</h4>
<p> The sinking of the TITANIC occurred on April 15, 1912, and acted as a catalyst
 for renewed federal action. As the disaster unfolded in the press, the status
 of wireless and wireless regulation &quot;were permanently altered.&quot; One
 ship, within twenty miles of the TITANIC, was equipped with wireless, but its
 sole operator had retired for the night, and the captain had shut down the ship's
 engines (which generated the electricity for the apparatus) while traveling through
 the iceberg field. Another ship, thirty miles away had no radio apparatus aboard.
 The CARPATHIA, which was fifty-eight miles away, and which rescued the survivors
 in lifeboats, only received the TITANIC'S SOS by luck. The ship's operator had
 returned to the wireless room to verify the ship's time and overheard the disaster
 signal when he put on his headphones. Soon after the CARPATHIA reached New York,
 the Senate Committee on Commerce began holding its preliminary hearings into
 the TITANIC disaster.</p>
<p> Within four months of the Senate hearings, the whole American radio scene
 shifted dramatically in the statist direction. Not only would the government
 supervise and regulate the air waves, but transmitting in the ether would no
 longer be an inherent right, but rather a privilege assigned by the State. Safety
 at sea was not the only legislative concern. Other political influences were
 at work. The Senate, on April 3, 1912, finally endorsed the treaty prepared at
 the second International Wireless Conference of 1906. &quot;A third convention
 was scheduled for June 1912, and the United States was informed that its delegates
 would not be welcome unless it ratified the treaty.&quot; Such inaction would
 place the United States outside the pale of the other &quot;civilized&quot; nations,
 all of which embraced statist control of the air waves. To remedy this, Congress
 passed appropriate legislation.</p>
<p> The Radio Act of 1912, which was to regulate radio until 1927, was approved
 on August 13, and took effect four months later, on December 13, 1912. The most
 significant passage in the Act was the provision that the Secretary of Commerce
 be empowered to issue licenses and make other regulations to sort out the wireless
 &quot;chaos.&quot; The Act required that all operators be licensed by the government,
 that stations use certain assigned frequencies, and that distress calls were
 to receive the highest priority. Amateurs were assigned a portion of the spectrum
 then considered useless-short waves of 200 meters or less. Congress finally adopted
 the international distress signal and mandated that every shore station listen
 in on the 300 meter band (the wavelength assigned for emergencies) every fifteen
 minutes. &quot;Intercommunications between systems was compulsory,&quot; and
 fines were provided for &quot;irresponsible transmission&quot; and &quot;malicious
 interference&quot; (at the time of the TITANIC disaster, amateurs had interrupted
 rescue efforts and provided false reports about the progress of the rescue mission).
 The new legislation allocated wavelengths according to the 1906 International
 Conference, so the military received the most useful wave bands. Naval stations
 were required to transmit and receive commercial messages if there was no commercial
 station within a 100 mile radius. The 1912 Act limited the issuance of licenses
 to citizens of the United States, and empowered the president &quot;to close
 private wireless stations, or to authorize the government to take them over&quot;
 in the event of war or disaster. The American Marconi Company supported the new
 regulations, which reinforced its own commercial monopoly in the U.S., since
 it had bought out or driven out of business its main competitors. &quot;With
 the amateurs assigned to the short waves and the Navy to the 600 to 1600 meter
 range, the regulation ensured that in America, the Marconi Company would have
 portions of the spectrum entirely to itself.&quot;</p>
<p> The Radio Act of 1912 clearly represents a watershed in the history of wireless.
 The &quot;one critical precedent this law established in broadcast history was
 the assumption&quot; that the ether was a collective national resource of the
 people of the United States, rather than private property of the first person
 or persons that used it regularly. &quot;Another precedent established was that
 the State would assume an important role in assigning property rights in the
 spectrum.&quot; There would be no free market or private property rights in the
 ether. Instead the federal government would implement and protect &quot;the people's
 interest&quot; in spectrum use by some standard of &quot;public convenience and
 necessity.&quot; Particular wavelengths could not be bought and sold. &quot;Rather,
 the State would determine priority on the basis of claimed needs, previous investment,
 and importance of the messages. Those claims would be acknowledged by wavelength
 allocations. What established merit in 1912 was capital investment or military
 defense, coupled with language that justified custodial claims based on an invaluable
 service to humanity. This, too, was a significant precedent. For, under the guise
 of social responsibility, of protecting the lives of innocents, and of managing
 a resource more efficiently, the military and a communications monopoly secured
 dominant positions in America's airwaves.&quot;</p>
<h4>World War I Rationalization and the Formation of RCA</h4>
<p> During the second decade of the 20th Century, the single most important influence
 on American radio was &quot;the Navy's increasingly proprietary attitude toward
 America's wireless system.&quot; Josephus Daniels who was Secretary of the Navy
 from 1913 to 1921, was &quot;an outspoken advocate of complete naval control
 of American wireless.&quot; &quot;World War I provided a most favorable political
 and ideological climate for the promotion of military wireless ambition&quot;
 in the United States. The war was used as an excuse for the Navy to gain full
 control over American wireless. Under the Radio Act of 1912, when the US formally
 declared war on April 6, 1917, President Wilson closed down or assumed control
 over all private radio stations in the United States. Amateurs were ordered off
 the air, and told to dismantle their stations (local police in New York searched
 for and seized over 800 amateur stations). Fifty-three stations (mostly American
 Marconi's) were taken over and added to the Navy's communication network. Another
 twenty-eight stations were closed down. By the end of the war, the Navy owned
 111 of the 127 commercial stations then in existence.</p>
<p> During 1918, the Navy's obsession to obtain total control of American radio
 was nearly achieved. Under its war powers, the Navy bought out one of Marconi's
 major competitors, Federal Telegraph, in May 1918, to prevent its being purchased
 by Marconi. Thus by the end of 1918, the Navy controlled all of the major elements
 of the budding broadcast industry, except-the amateurs (who were at that time
 outlawed), Marconi's long distance stations, the patent on the vacuum tube, and
 General Electric's alternator. Since the military, especially the Navy, was the
 only buyer of radio equipment during the war, it was able to dictate equipment
 specifications, production schedules, suppliers, and prices. The Navy even threatened
 the Crocker-Wheeler Company with government take-over, when it refused to turn
 over the blueprints of its motor-generators to its chief competitor, General
 Electric. The Navy was also responsible for imposing a patent moratorium in the
 radio industry. This made it possible for suppliers to use the best components,
 regardless of who owned the patent.</p>
<p> By the summer of 1919, it was clear that the press, Congress, and the public
 would not support Secretary of the Navy Daniels' attempts to assert control over
 the post-war wireless industry. Since the Navy was afraid that the Marconi Company
 would regain its prominence and have control of, or access to, American technology,
 naval officials began orchestrating the formation of an all-American company
 that would buy out American Marconi. Such a company would forever end all foreign
 interests in America's wireless communication network. This new company was to
 be the Radio Corporation of America, and it was incorporated with the Navy's
 blessings in October 1919. E.J. Nally, president of American Marconi, became
 the first president of RCA. American Marconi was forced to turn over all of its
 stations and employees to the new corporation, which was formed as a government-
 sanctioned monopoly.</p>
<p> Even after the formation of RCA, the Navy remained a potent influence in the
 post World War I environment. Stanford Hooper of the Navy engineered industrial
 cross-licensing agreements of radio patents between members of the Radio Group
 or Radio Trust. This group included RCA, GE, Westinghouse, and United Fruit (whose
 wireless operations combed Central America). The most important legacy, however,
 left by naval control of radio during World War I was the belief that radio was
 a natural monopoly and that only as a monopoly could radio function in the U.S.</p>
<h4>The Post-War Amateur Boom and Commercial Broadcasting</h4>
<p> Although amateur radio had a strong foothold before the war, the government
 ban on amateur receiving stations was not lifted until April 12, 1919. Amateurs
 were not permitted to transmit until September 26, 1919. Groups like the American
 Radio Relay League, which had held its first cross-country message relay in 1916,
 and which had been formed two years earlier to unite radio amateurs in a grass-roots,
 coast-to-coast communications network, which &quot;made it possible for the private
 citizen to communicate across great distances without the aid of either the government
 or a corporation,&quot; sprang back into action. By 1920, the Department of Commerce
 counted over 10,000 licensed amateur radio operators.</p>
<p> Frank Conrad was one of the most famous amateurs. He was a gifted engineer
 who worked for Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. By May 1920, the local
 newspaper was reporting on his radio concerts, which included live performances
 on piano, and phonograph music. Seeing an opportunity to increase sales of radio
 sets, the Joseph Horne Department Store in Sept. 1920 ran an ad in the PITTSBURGH
 SUN describing the Conrad radio concerts and informing the public that sets capable
 of receiving these concerts were on sale for $10. Finally, a Westinghouse vice-president
 realized that the real wireless market was in commercial-broadcasting. Westinghouse
 had Conrad set up a commercial broadcasting station at its plant, and began building
 radio receivers for home use. The Westinghouse station, KDKA began operating
 Nov. 2, 1920, in time to report on the presidential election.</p>
<p> &quot;Over the next year and a half, the 'broadcasting boom' swept the United
 States, beginning in the northeast, and moving south and west, reaching unprecedented
 levels of intensity by the spring of 1922.&quot; Many of the features we now
 take for granted, such as time signal service, broadcasting of baseball games
 and other sporting events, theatrical programs, and political interviews were
 all inaugurated during 1921 and 1922. In 1922, the AT&amp;T flagship station
 WEAF introduced the first advertisements over the air. By 1927, it was estimated
 that the retail value of receiving sets, parts, and accessories amounted to about
 $500 million, compared to about $2 million in 1920. Over 7.5 million radio sets
 had been produced in 7 years, and in the same period the number of organized
 broadcasting stations had grown from one to over 700.</p>
<p> When the first commercial station made application in 1921, for a federal
 radio license under the Radio Act of 1912, the Secretary of Commerce, who was
 charged with the issuance and administration of the radio licensing system, found
 himself in a quandary because it represented a new class of station. Although
 the Act itself provided for a system which primarily served as a station registry,
 the Secretary assigned each station a wave length under which it was to operate.
 Eventually, it was decided to license the station on a wave length of 360 meters,
 because that would place it far enough from frequencies used by other classes
 of users, such as ships, the military and amateurs. As other broadcasting stations
 applied for licenses, they, too, were placed on the same wave length (and eventually
 on the 400 meter band, too), so that by 1923, there were several hundred commercial
 transmitters potentially interfering with one another. In many cases, this interference
 was real because the stations were in close enough geographical proximity to
 cause interference.</p>
<p> At the same time, the case of Hoover vs. Intercity was decided in the appeal
 courts. Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Commerce in 1921, had refused to renew the
 broadcasting license of Intercity Radio Company, Inc. on the grounds that he
 was unable to find a wave length to assign whose use would not interfere with
 others. Intercity sued and, in the final decision rendered in February 1923,
 it was held that &quot;the Secretary of Commerce had no discretion to refuse
 the license. ...&quot; In effect, the court declared that any one had the right
 to apply for and receive a license from the Secretary of Commerce, though the
 Secretary had some discretion in the assigning of wave lengths to them. Partly
 as a result of the outcome of this case, Hoover called a general conference of
 all radio interests in an attempt to bring some &quot;order&quot; to the air
 waves. At the conference, the frequency spectrum was divided up so that each
 type of radio service (ships, shore stations, transoceanic stations, amateurs,
 and commercial broadcasters, etc.) had its own special frequency zone, and within
 the zone, each broadcaster was assigned a particular channel.</p>
<p> This and subsequent annual conferences, helped clear up some of the congestion
 in the air. So long as there were not too many stations, and none of them were
 using high power (at the time, a 300 watt station was the standard size) there
 were few complaints of interference. However, since the Intercity decision did
 not permit the Secretary of Commerce to deny applications for radio licenses,
 there was a proliferation of requests. Soon there were over 500 commercial stations
 in the country, and there was no longer any room in the commercial portion of
 the broadcasting frequency zone in which to assign them wave lengths. Consequently,
 by the end of 1925, the Department of Commerce ceased issuing any new commercial
 radio licenses.</p>
<p> While this was occurring, the government brought criminal charges against
 the Zenith Radio Corporation for violating the terms of its license which had
 been granted in early 1925. The Zenith license stipulated that the station must
 use the wave length of 332.4 meters, and its hours of operations were limited
 from 10 to 12 pm on Thursday, and then only when the use of this time was not
 desired by the General Electric Station in Denver. Zenith, by its own admission,
 broadcast at times and on wave lengths not specified in its license. The decision
 rendered in April 1926, held that the Secretary of Commerce &quot;had no power
 to make regulations and was to issue licenses&quot; according to the Radio Act
 of 1912, whose only requirement was that the wave lengths be less than 600 meters
 and more than 1600 meters.</p>
<p> As one attorney at the time put it, &quot;As a result of this ruling, the
 entire regulatory system broke down.&quot; The Department could not legally prohibit
 the issuance of licenses. Within 10 months an additional 200 commercial stations
 were licensed. In July 1926, the stations then in existence were using 378,000
 watts of power. By March 1927, that wattage had nearly doubled. The broadcasting
 industry was in a state of confusion. Stations would change frequencies as well
 as the output. Many stations could not air their programs, and the listening
 public was entirely discouraged and dissatisfied by the fact that nearly every
 transmission was accompanied by the whistles and squeals from interfering stations.</p>
<p> In an article on the &quot;Law of the Air&quot; published in 1928, it was
 pointed out that there were two ways in which this predicament might have been
 handled. First, the broadcasting industry itself must have eventually come to
 the realization that it was on a self-destructive course, and taken measures
 to &quot;regulate itself, relying upon the courts to handle the situation in
 accordance with the fundamental rules of law which had been found applicable
 in other similar conditions.&quot; This in fact was happening. Even before the
 Zenith decision, some stations had made agreements among themselves as to the
 hours during which they might broadcast and as to the frequencies they might
 use. &quot;Many stations made the best of the situation and, by contract, worked
 out a satisfactory and amicable schedule of hours.&quot; Such contracts and agreements
 had been upheld in federal court (see Carmichael v. Anderson, 14 Fed 2nd 166,
 July 19, 1926) even apart from the invalidity of any Department of Commerce licensing
 restrictions.</p>
<p> There was another way in which the broadcast industry was beginning to control
 its excesses. Many older stations refused to share time with the newer stations
 and were coming to claim &quot;the exclusive right to use a wave length free
 from interference, by reason of priority of appropriation.&quot; The foremost
 case upholding the idea of homesteading rights was a state decision in the Circuit
 Court of Cook County, Illinois on November 17, 1926. In Tribune Co. v. Oak Leaves
 Broadcasting Station, the chancellor was influenced by four types of common law
 cases. The two most important were those dealing with prior appropriation of
 water in the western states and trade-name cases. The western doctrine was that
 the first appropriator of the water of a stream was rightfully entitled to its
 use as against all other comers. This doctrine applied to both irrigation and
 mining and was the outgrowth of the customary usage of the western pioneers.
 By analogous reasoning, it was held that the Chicago Daily Tribune's station,
 WGN (World's Greatest Newspaper) had &quot;created and carried out for itself
 a particular right or easement in and to the use of&quot; its customary wave
 length, and that outsiders should not be able to deprive them of that right.
 Furthermore, the use of call letters and dial readings enabled listeners to identify
 each particular station on their receiving apparatus. These identifiers were
 similar in nature to trade-marks or trade-names, and were used by the stations
 to build patronage, popularity, and goodwill. The court concluded that &quot;priority
 of time creates a superiority in right&quot; in the property of a commercial
 broadcaster.</p>
<p> The Tribune decision intensified the fear of legislators and regulators that
 licensees under the Radio Act of 1912 would ultimately be able to assert proprietary
 rights in the courts. This prompted the passage of a Joint Resolution of Congress
 on December 8, 1926 that mandated that all existing commercial broadcasting licenses
 expire in 90 days, and required all &quot;licensees to file their waiver of any
 assertion of proprietary interest in a license or frequency as against the regulatory
 power of the United States.&quot; This echoed an earlier Senate resolution, passed
 in 1925, in which the airwaves and the use thereof had been declared to be &quot;the
 inalienable possession of the people of the United States... .&quot; Instead
 of allowing property rights in the spectrum to develop, Congress passed a new
 federal radio law on February 23, 1927.</p>
<p> The Federal Radio Act of 1927 strengthened the principle of statism underlying
 the earlier law of 1912. The new law exerted stringent controls over the broadcasting
 industry. First, it stated that 60 days after the passage of the act, all licenses
 would be terminated. Second, it clearly stated that broadcasting was not a right,
 but rather a privilege granted by the United States. Third, it created the Federal
 Radio Commission, whose powers were eventually transferred to the Federal Communications
 Commission in 1934. Finally, it embraced language of the earlier Joint Resolution
 of Congress by providing elaborate provisions against the assertion of any property
 rights in a frequency.</p>
<p> In his 1959 article, &quot;The Federal Communications Commission,&quot; Ronald
 Coase analyzed the rationale behind the broadcasting regulatory system and the
 events which preceded government regulation. He cited Charles A. Siepmann's book,
 RADIO, TELEVISION, AND SOCIETY (1950) which provides the standard justification
 for the Radio Act of 1927: &quot;Private enterprise, over seven long years, failed
 to set its own house in order. Cutthroat competition at once retarded radio's
 orderly development and subjected listeners to intolerable strain and inconvenience.
 &quot; Coase puts these reasons to rest by explaining that the views of Siepmann
 and others are faulty because they &quot;are based on a misunderstanding of the
 problem.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>(T)he real cause of the trouble was that no property rights were created in
 these scarce frequencies. We know from our ordinary experience that land can
 be allocated to land users without the need for government regulation by using
 the price mechanism. But if no property rights were created in land, so that
 everyone could use a tract of land, it is clear that there would be considerable
 confusion and that the price mechanism could not work because there would not
 be any property rights that could be acquired. If one person could use a piece
 of land for growing a crop, and then another person could come along and build
 a house on the land used for the crop ... it would no doubt be accurate to describe
 the resulting situation as chaos. But it would be wrong to blame this on private
 enterprise and the competitive system. A private-enterprise system cannot function
 properly unless property rights are created in resources, and, when this is done,
 someone wishing to use a resource has to pay the owner to obtain it. Chaos disappears;
 and so does the government except that a legal system to define property rights
 and to arbitrate disputes is, of course, necessary.</blockquote>
<p> While this is not the place to challenge Coase's assumption that we need a
 governmental legal system, the main thrust of his argument is true. The fact
 of the matter is that the participants in the commercial broadcasting industry
 were acting in such a manner as to bring about the recognition of property rights
 and of the right to be free of interference in their broadcasting activities.
 Of course, it is difficult to say what would have happened had the Radio Act
 of 1927 not been passed. But reviewing the history of wireless and the radio
 it was nearly a foregone conclusion that the State would somehow assert its dominance
 in this media. From the very first, the State recognized the wireless' potential
 as a strategic military weapon. Later it realized its propaganda value. Although
 it was voluntaryism which made possible the invention of wireless and its commercial
 developments, it was the aggressive nature of the State and its military that
 was mostly responsible for the way radio became a handmaiden of the State.</p>
