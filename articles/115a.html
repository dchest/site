 <h2>Evolution to Voluntaryism</h2>
 <h4>by Kurt Fuller<br>
  Number 115 - 4<sup>th</sup> Quarter 2002</h4>
</center>
<p> How does one become a voluntaryist? Are you born that way? Is a life-changing
 event required? Do you need to be convinced? The answer probably is different
 for different people. In fact, there may be as many answers as there are voluntaryists.
 In my case, the road to voluntaryism was a very gradual process, taking about
 four decades.</p>
<p>My upbringing was fairly typical for a child of the 50s and 60s. I came from
 a blue collar, union manufacturing, Mississippi River town in Iowa. My dad worked
 for his entire career as an electrician at the largest factory in town. Dad was
 a union man all the way, having been President of the Cellophane Workers of America
 for many years. As you might suspect, he almost always voted straight Democratic.</p>
<p>As a child, I considered myself to be a staunch Democrat, though there was
 really no reason for it beyond the fact that my dad was a Democrat. I never thought
 much about or spent any time on the issues. To me, politics was a game, and the
 game was fun to watch, especially at the national level. I was fascinated by
 delegate counts, caucuses, primaries, and state-by-state strategies.</p>
<p>Later in life, I discovered that the politicians also view it as a game, though
 they portray to the public that they care only about issues and principles. My
 parents, teachers, and fellow citizens reinforced the notion that I had it all
 wrong, and that the issues were what I should be following, not delegate counts.</p>
<p>During my senior year in high school, I received the biggest shock of my life,
 politically speaking. My Government teacher (a staunch Democrat) gave us a test
 with a series of questions about various political and social issues. The purpose
 of the test was to categorize you as a Democrat or a Republican. I was stunned
 to discover that my views were very much Republican. I had always been opposed
 to welfare, unemployment insurance, progressive income taxation, etc., but was
 too busy playing the game to realize that my views were almost completely opposite
 those of my beloved Democratic Party.</p>
<p>From that point forward, I started paying attention to the issues. Though neither
 Richard Nixon nor Gerald Ford did much for me personally, I voted for and rooted
 for both of them. It was hard to root for Republicans because I had always rooted
 for Democrats. It was like rooting against your favorite baseball team.</p>
<p>As my knowledge of the issues (and of myself) increased, I became interested
 in &quot;fringe&quot; candidates. In 1980, I was a rabid supporter of John Anderson.
 He was different from the rest, and he espoused many of my beliefs. My feeling
 was that he had a chance to win as a third party candidate. But a funny thing
 happened on the way to the voting booth.</p>
<p>A few months before the election, I stumbled across Milton Friedman's <em>Free
 to Choose</em> series on PBS. It was so fascinating that I bought the book and
 read it cover-to-cover in about three days. It was my first comprehensive introduction
 to free-market thinking. My view of the world would never be the same.</p>
<p>Then about a month before the election, a friend of mine showed me a magazine
 article about Ed Clark, the Libertarian Party candidate. It blew me away. Here
 was a guy who lined up perfectly with my beliefs. This was the way to go! However,
 I still voted for Anderson. So much of myself was invested into his candidacy,
 that I couldn't bring myself to vote for Ed Clark, but the positive consequence
 of the whole thing was that it killed my 20 year passion for playing the political
 game.</p>
<p>From that point forward, I &quot;knew&quot; that the Libertarian Party was
 the answer to America's political problems. It was just a matter of working hard
 to get the message out, and convincing people that we had a chance. There are
 some great people involved in the Libertarian Party, and they have done some
 outstanding work toward the cause of freedom and free markets. Working with them
 and being exposed to their work was and is euphoric. I devoted a significant
 chunk of my life and my resources to the betterment of the movement.</p>
<p>As time went on, I became discouraged with the idea of achieving freedom through
 the Libertarian Party. The problem we were trying to solve was too much government
 in our lives. Or maybe the problem was government, period. How could we solve
 the problem of too much government by electing people to &quot;serve&quot; as
 part of the government? How would we convince enough people to vote for our candidates
 without compromising our positions? Did we really think we were going to win
 elections by advocating legalization of drugs, pornography, and the carrying
 of concealed weapons?</p>
<p>When openly questioning the idea of achieving freedom through the Libertarian
 Party, I would ask, &quot;How can we solve the problem by utilizing the problem?&quot;
 People would usually just look at me, as if to say, &quot;You have to participate
 in government if you want to reform it.&quot; That certainly is the universally
 accepted way of solving problems. On the other hand, thousands of years of history
 show it as a universal failure. After ten years of hard work, I dropped my membership
 to the Libertarian Party.</p>
<p>Government itself is the problem. Getting rid of it became my goal. Anarchy
 is defined as the lack of government. Unfortunately, the word anarchy means chaos
 to most people. They have been conditioned to believe that without government,
 the world would be one big riot with people shooting at each other all day long.
 The Wild West would be tame by comparison. I got absolutely nowhere trying to
 convince people that anarchy is the way to go.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I stumbled across The Voluntaryist, and Carl Watner's book,
 I Must Speak Out. These writings shed an entirely different light on the lack
 of government. Instead of chaos, voluntaryism is based on order, peaceful relationships,
 self-interest, respect for the rights of others, and morality. It teaches that
 the end does not justify the means. It shares real-life, historical examples
 of problems that were solved through cooperation and self-interest, not force
 or theft. I still may not be able to convince anyone else of its merits. But
 for me, voluntaryism is the answer I have been seeking all these years. </p>
