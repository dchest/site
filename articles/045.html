 <h2>Some FREE LIFE Sayings</h2>
 <h4>by Auberon Herbert<br>
  From Number 45 - August 1990</h4>
</center>
<p> [<strong>The Free Life</strong> was an English journal edited by Auberon Herbert
 from the late 1880's till the early 1900's. This excerpt is from the issue of
 May, 1893.]</p>
<p><strong>Free Life</strong> has scanty reverence for Crowns, Governments, official
 departments, Members of Parliament, County councillors, Party caucuses, or nose-led
 majorities; it exposes the ridiculous attempt to represent 50,000 different persons
 by one person on all the great subjects of life; hates the untruthful bribing
 politician; hates the traffic in votes; hates the Party fight; hates officialism,
 without hating officials; hates State-made piety of any kind; hates State socialism,
 land nationalization, unearned-increment superstitions, land courts, State-dictated
 contracts, and all other unhealthy inventions of the State-worshiping brain;
 would allow Free Trade, free enterprise, free initiative, free arrangement to
 develop in every direction; hates the damnable practice of voting property out
 of one set of pockets into another set of pockets, because it corrupts the public
 sense of what is fair to each other, because it teaches the hypocritical doctrine
 that it is wrong to bludgeon and rob your neighbor on the highroad, but right
 to knock him down with majority-vote, and pillage him by Act of Parliament, because
 it magnifies the office and exalts the horn of the politician, - who should be
 reduced to the lowest point of insignificance, - because it supplies that worthy
 gentlemen with exactly what he wants most, a bribery-fund to secure reputation,
 place, aand power for himself, because it makes Parliament into a little god,
 inflated with conceit and believing itself supreme over all persons and all things,
 and because it creates the most hopeless confusion as regards the exertions by
 which the industrious have to gain competence and wealth. <strong>Free Life</strong>
 resolutely defends private property, as inseperably connected with liberty or
 self-ownership (since the free self, its free exercise of faculties, its freedom
 to acquire, to produce, to exchange, in the open markets of the world, form one
 inviolable whole), and as far more productive of happiness and contentment than
 those sham forms of property, which being placed under a State lock and key,
 are subject to no real control or enjoyment on the part of the individual. Free
 Life believes that only in Liberty - Liberty in thinking, acting, acquiring,
 and enjoyment - is salvation to be found; and labours to help forward a future,
 in which men and women, unspoilt by nursery government, erect and self-confident,
 bowing the knee neither to power nor fashion nor tradition, accustomed to use
 their own senses instead of the senses either of the crowd or of the politicians,
 minding their own business, finding their own happiness, after their own liking,
 making their mistakes and learning from them, ready to co-operate in friendly
 temper with each other because uncoerced, and able to submit themselves voluntarily
 - whenever needful - to discipline, shall agree to reject compulsion in every
 form equally for themselves and for all others. ...</p>
<p>It is in no selfish spirit that <strong>Free Life</strong> preaches Voluntaryism.
 It wishes no individual to wrap himself up in his own special interests; it wishes
 no part of the nation to retreat from any true duties which fall upon it, either
 within or without the borders of this country. But it denies that any good or
 lasting work can be built upon the compulsion of others, be they rich or poor;
 it denies that either by those who compel or from those who are compelled, can
 the peaceful and happy society of the future be built. It invites all men to
 abandon the barren problems of force, and to give themselves up to the happy
 problems of liberty and friendly co-operation; to join in thinking out - whilst
 first and foremost we give to the individual those full rights over himself and
 over whatever is his, without which all effort is vain - how we can best carry
 on a common life, and manage public property; how we can best assist each other
 in the perfection of education, in the spreading of sanitary knowledge, in improving
 the conditions of labour, in attacking poverty, in purifying and beautifying
 the life of our towns, in organizing voluntary defence, in helping distant communities
 that are related to us or partly dependent on us; how we can do all these things,
 - without at any point touching with the least of our fingers the hateful instrument
 of an aggressive and unjustifiable compulsion. </p>
