 <h2>Why I Write And Publish <i>The Voluntaryist</i></h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  Number 93 - Aug 1998</h4>
</center>
<p>As I compose this article, I have only a few more issues of <i>The Voluntaryist</i>
 to write and publish before I reach No. 100. Once completed, that effort will
 have spanned nearly seventeen years of my life. During that time I have been
 imprisoned for forty days on a federal civil contempt charge (1982); married
 Julie (1986); witnessed the homebirths of our four children; operated two businesses
 here in South Carolina (one of them a feed mill, I have been running since my
 marriage; the other, a retail tire store and service center I took over in early
 1997); have been responsible for the building of our family's house; and participate
 in the homeschooling of all our children. Although <i>The Voluntaryist</i> has been
 an important and constant part of my life all this time, the first article that
 I wrote and published preceded <i>The Voluntaryist</i> by nearly a decade. It was &quot;Lysander
 Spooner: Libertarian Pioneer&quot; and appeared in Reason Magazine in March 1973.</p>
<p>As I reflect upon my writing career. I recall one of my very first self-published
 monographs - <b>Towards A Theory of Proprietary Justice</b>. In it there was a piece
 titled &quot;Let It Not Be Said That I Did Not Speak Out!&quot;. There is obviously
 something in my mental-spiritual-physical constitution that needs a publishing
 outlet. It is important to me to set forth my ideas, especially when they are
 so very different from the vast majority of people that I associate with most
 of the time. If everyone seems to be heading toward a precipice, they need to
 be warned. If I am pushed and shoved along with them, even if I am powerless
 to stop the crowd, it is important to me and my integrity that some record be
 left of my resistance and of my recognition that we are headed toward danger.
 &quot;Let It Not Be Said That I Did Not Speak Out!&quot; was published in 1976,
 and appears now in the pages of <i>The Voluntaryist</i> for the first time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> When the individuals living under the jurisdiction of the United States Government
 awake to political reality, they are going to find themselves living in government
 bondage. Every act of government brings us closer to this reality. The only logical
 future is to expect life in a socialized state. Henceforth, to be a citizen will
 mean to be a slave.</p>
<p> To speak the truth without fear is the only resistance I am bound to display.
 To disseminate without reserve all the principles with which I am acquainted
 and to do so on every occasion with the most persevering constancy, so that my
 acquiescence to injustice will not be assumed, is my self-assumed obligation.</p>
<p> The honest among us realize that the resort to coercion is a tacit confession
 of imbecility. If he who employs force against me could mold me to his purposes
 by argument, no doubt he would.</p>
<p> The alternative is then simply living by the libertarian principle that no
 person or group of people is entitled to resort to violence or its threat in
 order to achieve their ends. This means that everyone, regardless of their position
 in the world, who is desirous of implementing their ideas must rely solely on
 voluntary persuasion and not on force or its threat.</p>
<p> Individuals make the world go round; individuals and only individuals exist.
 No man has any duty towards his fellow men except to refrain from the initiation
 of violence. Nothing is due a man in strict justice but what is his own. To live
 honestly is to hurt no one and to give to every one his due.</p>
<p> . . . Justice will not come to reign unless those who care for its coming
 are prepared to insist upon its value and have the courage to speak out against
 what they know to be wrong.</p>
<p> Let it not be said that I did not speak out against tyranny! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as any other piece I have ever written, it probably best explains why
 I have devoted so much time to <i>The Voluntaryist</i> over the years. There
 is an episode in Ayn Rand's <i>Anthem</i> in which the protagonist, Equality
 7-2521, discovers a room full of books, someone's personal library, that had
 escaped the book-burning that undoubtedly had accompanied the creation of the
 collectivist holocaust in which he lived. It was among these books that he rediscovered
 the word &quot;I&quot; which had disappeared from the current lexicon. My hope
 is that <i>The Voluntaryist</i> message - that a non-violent and stateless society
 is both moral and practical - will survive, just like the books that Equality
 found. Hopefully, if someone in the future finds copies of <i>The Voluntaryist</i>
 newsletter or the anthology that I am proposing to publish (see accompanying
 article) they will help to re-kindle, re-discover, or elaborate the ideal of
 a totally free market society. One doesn't need to be a pessimist to see that
 those ideas might one day disappear. Even in our own time, only a small part
 of the population enbraces libertarian ideas; and only a small number of libertarians
 would consider themselves voluntaryists - people who reject voting and the legitimacy
 of the State. Even the individualism of several centuries of American history
 is in danger of being obliterated by State propaganda. With luck, <i>The Voluntaryist</i>
 will play some small part in preserving a record of those times in history when
 men were free to act without State interference, and were self-confident enough
 to know that the State possesses no magical powers.</p>
<p>May knowledge and wisdom come to those who read <i>The Voluntaryist</i>. Long live
 voluntaryist ideas. </p>
