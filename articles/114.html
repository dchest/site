 <h2>Non-Voting as an Act of Secession</h2>
 <h4>by Hans Sherrer<br>
  Number 114 - 3<sup>rd</sup> Quarter 2002</h4>
</center>
<p> In 1776, the Declaration of Independence made it plain that in America, &quot;Governments
 are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
 governed, - That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive..., it is
 the Right of the People to alter or abolish it,...&quot; The consent theory stated
 by the Declaration is standard fare in American politics. The Declaration, however,
 failed to address a very important question: How do individuals express their
 disapproval of a political regime and/or withdraw their consent from a government
 that they deem &quot;destructive?&quot;</p>
<p>There are several methods that Americans have used to demonstrate their lack
 of consent. One way is to renounce allegiance to an existing political order.
 The colonists in North America seceded from the British empire by successfully
 waging the Revolutionary War. On the other hand, the eleven Confederate states
 removed themselves from the federal union from 1861-1865, before being forcibly
 reintegrated back into the United States.[1]</p>
<p>A second way someone can express a lack of consent is to move to a different
 country. This is what several commentators have called &quot;the exit option.&quot;[2]
 History teaches that the last resort of the individual against tyranny is to
 escape from its jurisdiction. The Jews left Egypt; the Separatists fled England.
 History is replete with examples of people who &quot;voted with their feet.&quot;</p>
<p>A third way people express a lack of consent is by not voting. Although political
 pundits might not call it a withdrawl of consent, the fact is that millions upon
 millions of Americans show their displeasure with their government by not registering
 for and/or casting a ballot in political elections. Non-voting represents an
 exit from political society. It is a silent form of &quot;social power&quot;
 that speaks volumes. Choosing not to vote may be a form of apathy, but it is
 simultaneously an expression of &quot;what I perceive is best for me.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, millions of non-voters are implicitly stating that voting is
 a meaningless and unimportant activity, so far as it applies to them and their
 loved ones in their own lives. After all, government programs, and spending and
 tax policies will continue regardless of how anyone votes. Furthermore, for those
 thinking individuals who understand that the government must &quot;get out the
 vote,&quot; the choice not to vote is a form of personal empowerment and a psychologically
 life-affirming act.[3] Those men and women who consciously choose not to participate
 in politics expose the lie behind the myth of &quot;government by consent.&quot;
 They have not consented to anything. In other words, their decision not to vote
 is a form of personal secession - the form of secession that is most readily
 available to them.[4]</p>
<p>This choice is exercised by many millions of Americans because they understand
 that elections are nothing more than tugs-of-war between tweedledum Democrats
 and tweedledee Republicans. Both parties seek the mantle of power to impose their
 agendas on society. Politicians of every political party want to continue the
 flow of tax money into the treasury and to pass laws allowing the government
 to increasingly invade the social spheres of daily life. As social commentator,
 one-time political candidate, and author Gore Vidal once noted: there is really
 only one political party in this country, and it has two incestuously related
 branches.[5]</p>
<p>Whether based on intuition or practical understanding, non-voters realize they
 only have a subservient role in the political structure described by Vidal. Without
 money, position or connections, they are disenfranchised from having any meaningful
 say-so in the government's impact on their lives. Yet, in spite of this handicap,
 choosing not to vote can have a dramatic and positive effect on society. This
 is because a government's survival is dependent on having a sufficient number
 of people grant it the appearance of legitimacy to act and elicit obedience.[6]</p>
<p>Whether it is an explicit intention or an implicit result, the decision not
 to vote is a way of decreasing governmental legitimacy. As Vladimir Bukovsky,
 the Russian dissident put it: &quot;Power rests on nothing other than people's
 consent to submit, and each person who refuses to submit to tyranny reduces it
 by one two-hundred-and-fifty-millionth, whereas each who compromises [with it]
 only increases it.&quot;[7] Finally, there reaches a point at which a government
 no longer has enough consensus to act under any authority other than the exercise
 of raw, naked power. Once the mirage of legitimacy is gone, a government must
 become openly despotic to remain in power. This, in turn, tends to turn even
 more people away from supporting it, and can put its continued existence in doubt.</p>
<p>This isn't armchair speculation. History records that variations of this scenario
 have occurred numerous times.[8] Who would have predicted that the Marco regime
 would fall from power in the Philippines? Who ever expected that the Communist
 government in Poland would be succeeded by Solidarity? Who ever thought that
 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics would &quot;splinter apart&quot; in what
 seemed like the blink of an eye? However, it is usually a surprise to the &quot;experts&quot;
 when it happens, because it occurs quickly and at a time when a State appears,
 from the outside, to be at the height of its power.</p>
<p>This phenomenon of seemingly sudden social change is explained by physicist
 Per Bak's theory of self-organizing criticality.[9] This theory, for example,
 explains how millions of grains of sand can methodically be added to a seemingly
 stable sand pile until a &quot;point of criticality&quot; is reached. At that
 point, adding only one more grain of sand will trigger an avalanche. Professor
 Bak's theory has been used to help understand such diverse things as traffic
 flow and the trading of stocks. It is equally applicable to the delegitimizing
 impact any one non-voter can have on a political regime.</p>
<p>It is within the realm of possibility that some day the illegitimacy of the
 government of the United States might reach the point of criticality. What would
 happen if impassioned non-voters used the many methods of modern communications
 to express their ideas and dissatisfaction to others? At first thought it might
 seem preposterous to seriously consider that government in the United States
 could become delegititized. It isn't. As sociologist Sebastian Scheerer has observed:
 &quot;[T]here has never been a major social transformation in the history of
 mankind that ha[s] not been looked upon as unrealistic, idiotic, or utopian by
 the large majority of experts even a few years before the unthinkable became
 reality.&quot;[10]</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons which the French author, Jacques Ellul, outlined in
 his book, <em>The Political Illusion</em>, non-voters choose to dispel the myth
 that the voters control the political process.[11] Instead of debasing themselves
 and dignifying the elections that have no positive impact on their lives, over
 a hundred million Americans regularly choose to distance themselves from the
 voting process and the political regime legitimized by it. They do so by selecting
 the option of not voting. The non-voters are right, and they are winning every
 election held in America.</p>
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p> 1) It should be noted that the Confederate States successfully seceded, and
 that each state had to reapply for admission to the United States. The States
 were occupied by federal troops in order to coerce them into complying with these
 conditions. If the use of coercion to abtain their &quot;consent&quot; was illegal
 and immoral (as it would be in obtaining a signature on an ordinary contract),
 then what does this say about the status of these states today?</p>
