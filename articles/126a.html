<h2>Grant No Man the Authority to Make You His Slave</h2>
<h4>by Peter Ragnar<br>From Number 126</h4>
</center>

<p>Are there any among us who would not decry the repugnancy of slavery? I am
  assuming, of course, that you have reached a higher station in your moral evolution
  than members of the common mob. Yet, isn&#8217;t it likely that the lowest serf,
  imprisoned as a nameless unit of the proletariat, abhors his forced servitude?
  Like a prisoner gazing beyond his bars, does not the indentured servant, in
  his most hopeful of moments, dream of freedom? I grant you it is possible some
  mindless automatons with lobotomized souls would equate their slavery with fate.
  Such people lack enough vitality in their being to even protest a perfunctory
  &#8220;I wish I were free,&#8221; and they are certainly not endowed with a
  single drop of originality in seeking it.</p>

<p> I salute you - the self-owned, the self-reliant, the independent heroes of
  freedom! You have refused to submit and surrender to the iron boots of slavery.
  You eschew tyranny and refuse to sanction the officious, pigheaded, bureaucratic
  assaults and intrusions upon your life. To you these assaults are as impotent
  as rag dolls. Yet they continue each day, fed by the mentality of the mindless
  mob granting what they have no right to grant, sanctioning what no one can sanction,
  and legitimizing what no one can make legitimate. </p>

<p> If it were not for a swarm of obedient servants, myriads mired in the morass
  of the mob mentality, even a Caesar or a Napoleon would be reduced to flaccid,
  vagrant nobodies. For whom is a Caesar, a Napoleon, or an Alexander the Great
  without their armies, their hordes of servants, and the greedy solicitous masses
  humbly beseeching them for perks?</p>

<p> Just imagine a Napoleon in his threadbare uniform, standing on a box in the
  city square and shouting political slogans, much like an itinerant evangelist
  seeking converts by wildly proselytizing like a madman. The local citizenry
  give him a wide berth, as one would sensibly do to anyone so afflicted. Such
  a clown could hardly be taken seriously, let alone obeyed. You would not grant
  such a one respect, nor approve of his desire to impose his will. Nor would
  you, as the case is today, sanction the will of the larger mob over the individual
  who does not wish to be enslaved. Grant no man the authority to make you his
  slave! Appoint no one your guardian. Accept no handouts from those distributing
  stolen property. Commit no criminal acts by accepting monies extorted from others.</p>

<p> When a government is installed by the voting majority it imposes a tribute
  upon all, known as taxation. Confiscations of property and imprisonment await
  those who refuse to pay voluntarily. Taxation, administered in this manner,
  is clearly theft. Morally, you have no right to be a co-conspirator in the aggressing
  and extorting of monies, or properties, or in the forced conscription of your
  own or your neighbor&#8217;s children being compulsorily sent to &#8220;school.&#8221;
  If you vote to sanction the unsanctionable, to legitimize the illegitimate,
  you criminalize yourself. And does your vote really matter (except as evidence
  that you accept the governmental system)? You only exchange one candidate for
  another, while the tyrant (the institution of government) remains the same!</p>

<p> Oh yes, you may agree that you have been burdened by government, and so seek
  solace by voting for change. You may feel that you are choosing the lesser of
  two evils. Here I implore you to bear in mind that the lesser of two evils is
  still evil! To endorse a little evil is similar to accepting a little carcinoma.
  Evil is still evil! This is more than the simple sin of looking in the other
  direction as a co-worker steals from his employer. This is your sanction of
  murder and theft! This is your approval of extortion! This is your endorsement
  of slavery! Can you cast a vote in good conscience that will result in the oppression
  and enslavement of others? When you vote for a candidate, you are in fact saying
  it is perfectly right for him to force your neighbor to submit to your desires
  -- desires which can be enforced at the point of a gun. Except in distancing
  yourself from the crime, is there really any difference between hiring someone
  to rob your neighbor and committing the act yourself? Even more serious is the
  fact that, by voting, you have essentially hired a hit man to kill the &#8220;others&#8221;
  with whom you disagree. Of course, if you hired the Mafia to do the dirty work,
  you&#8217;d go to prison if you were caught. You escape responsibility by voting
  and having government agents act on your behalf. The crimes are identical. The
  only difference is that the first method is &#8220;politically&#8221; approved
  and legal, and the second is not.</p>

<p> Bear in mind, laws of convention made and enforced by the collective are not
  like the laws of nature, which, when violated, extract perfect retribution.
  Therefore, in the furtherance of my own evolution, I can only say &#8220;NO&#8221;
  to ALL the candidates. So you see, in a sense I am casting a &#8220;NO&#8221;
  vote against all of them. My choice is simply &#8220;None of the Above!&#8221;
  One candidate may steal from me more or less than the other, but that&#8217;s
  not the point. The basic premise, for honest conscious minds, is that stealing
  cannot be legitimized. Your integrity should never allow you to cast a vote.
  Do not sanction your own enslavement. Grant no man the authority to make you
  his slave. Grant no man the power to enslave your neighbor, grant no man the
  sanction to steal or murder in your name, lest you cause yourself irreparable
  moral damage. When asked how one could be a free man and yet a slave, the ancient
  Athenian sage, Diogenes, answered, &#8220;Simply, by the number of times you
  say <em>master</em>.&#8221; Diogenes, who recognized no master, always embraced
  a NO vote. He argued that Athenians, who voted by casting various-colored beans
  into a receptacle, should &#8220;Abstain from beans.&#8221; </p>

<p> Once, while sunbathing by the river, Diogenes was approached by Alexander
  the Great. Alexander&#8217;s shadow loomed over the reclining, naked Diogenes.
  &#8220;Do you know who I am?&#8221; asked Alexander. &#8220;That&#8217;s not
  the question you should be asking,&#8221; retorted Diogenes. &#8220;You should
  be asking if <em>you</em> know who <em>you</em> are.&#8221; Alexander, like
  all avaricious, unctuous politicians, was asking the same banal and prosaic
  question, namely: Do you recognize my authority to control you? Do you acknowledge
  my power over you? Diogenes&#8217; refusal to kowtow to Alexander simply meant
  Diogenes recognized no authority except &#8220;the primacy of his own right
  judgment.&#8221; Freedom, in Diogenes&#8217; view, was the &#8220;absolute dominion
  over his own will. This was the inner realm over which no outside force, not
  even an Alexander and all his soldiers, had any power, whatsoever.&#8221; </p>

<p> Regaining his composure, Alexander boasted, &#8220;I&#8217;m Alexander the
  Great!&#8221; Unimpressed, Diogenes, in a dismissive tone replied, &#8220;So,
  be Alexander the Great!&#8221; No one had ever spoken to Alexander with such
  self-assured authority before. In fact, no one could, except the individual
  who knows that no person can truly control another. Now feeling more like the
  average solicitous bureaucrat, Alexander adopted a more servile attitude, offering,
  &#8220;Is there anything I can do for you?&#8221; Casually waving his hand,
  Diogenes replied, &#8220;Move over. You&#8217;re blocking my sunlight.&#8221;</p>

<p> So what are you waiting for? You should dismiss these pompous pinheads with
  a wave of your hands, instead of using them to pull the lever in the voting
  booth.</p>
<p> You were born free and you should remain free. You need no one to speak for
  you. You require no guardians. You have no need for an elder brother watching
  over your shoulder. You will learn from your own mistakes and grow strong by
  them. You require no handouts. For it is only by your own hand, and by voluntarily
  trading with others, that you can honestly obtain all the fruitage for the greater
  life. You may fail or you may succeed, but only so long as you grant no man
  the authority to make you his slave may you pursue your quest for a more bountiful
  life. </p>
