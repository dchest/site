<h2>My Reaction to Voluntaria</h2>
<h4>By Charles Gutierrez<br />
From Issue 122</h4>
</center>

<p>Sometimes I am asked, "... but if we didn't have government, who would
provide defense and police services and the utilities and the roads...and early
childhood education?" My questioners usually conclude, " If everyone
believed like you we'd have ANARCHY!" I usually answer by referring
to some of Carl Watner's articles in his anthology, <i>I Must Speak Out</i>.
Carl's book is filled with real life stories of how man in this world has provided
for himself without the &quot;charitable&quot; help of coercive government; but it is long and
takes careful reading. What is available for a child or for those
grownups whose interest in liberty is still young and timid? <i>Princess
Navina Visits Voluntaryia</i> is perfect. It is an entertaining and effective
story that makes one wonder if a voluntary society without government is
possible. My children sat enthralled as they listened to their daily chapter; and
my wife and I were engrossed as well. It is easy and attractive reading.</p>

<p>Princess Navina, in her exploration of world cultures, discovers Voluntaria. She
searches high and low for any traces of government, but all she finds is a
people who mind their own affairs, who meet the common needs of life,
including justice and utilities and public order, by creative free enterprise in a
fertile free market. This little book has renewed my belief that a just
society is possible, and is a lot easier than reading than Ayn Rand or Carl
Watner. Is it as big or filled with educational details as these other books? No.
 Is it as inspiring as <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>? Yes, in its own simple way.
Will this book garner a Caldecott Medal? Is it great literature by New
York or Parisian or Cuban standards? Probably not: but it is great
storytelling, and a delightful read for lovers of liberty. It is my new
answer to those who say "If everyone believed like you we'd have ANARCHY!"
I say, "No, if everyone believed like I do we'd have VOLUNTARIA!"</p>

<p><i>Princess Navina Visits Voluntaryia</i> comes off as a &quot;harmless&quot; little book
which could begin a beautiful revolution in the hearts of all, both young and old.
I highly recommend it.</p>
