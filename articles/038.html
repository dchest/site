 <h2>Freedom Works Both Ways</h2>
 <h4>by Dean Russell<br>
  From Number 38 - June 1989</h4>
</center>
<p> Everybody says he's in favor of freedom. Even the Soviet leaders claim to
 be fighting for freedom. So did Hitler. Our own leaders are also for freedom.
 So was my slave-owning grandfather.</p>
<p>But my grandfather failed to understand the fact that freedom is a <em>mutual</em>
 relationship; that it works both ways. He thought that he himself remained completely
 free even though he restricted the freedom of others. He never grasped the obvious
 fact that his participation in slavery controlled him and his actions just as
 it controlled his slaves and their actions. Both my grandfather and his slaves
 would have been richer - materially as well as spiritually - if he had freed
 his slaves, offered them the competitive market wage for their services, and
 left them totally responsible for their own actions and welfare. But like most
 of us today, he continues to believe that some persons - without injury to themselves
 - can legally force other persons to conform to their wishes and plans. He learned
 the hard way.</p>
<p>Hitler and Stalin were also victims of the systems they created and enforced.
 Their &quot;food tasters,&quot; bullet-proof cars, personal bodyguards and constant
 fears of assassination were the visible evidence of a part of the freedom they
 lost when they decided to force <em>peaceful</em> persons to conform to their
 wills and viewpoints. Knowingly or unknowingly, they lost a great deal of their
 own freedom when they deprived others of their freedom. That's the way it always
 works.</p>
<p>Apparently, our own political leaders, regardless of party are also unaware
 that freedom is a mutual relationship among persons; that it works both ways.
 Like my grandfather, they are under the delusion that freedom is something which
 one person can take from another with no effect on the freedom of the person
 doing the taking - especially if it's legal. If they thought otherwise, they
 would stop most of the things they are now doing. In the good name of freedom,
 our leaders now force others to conform to their viewpoints and prejudices on
 housing, savings and retirement, military service, electricity production, hours
 of work, wages, education and a host of other items which form the major part
 of every person's daily life. All of these are restrictions against freedom because
 they are enforced against <em>peaceful</em> persons who would not participate
 voluntarily. The freedom of the American people - like the freedom of legal slaves
 - is lost to whatever extent they are forced to conform to the ideas, whims and
 viewpoints of others. That is all that slavery is. And the fact that the current
 restrictions and compulsions are legal doesn't deny that they are acts against
 freedom; the slavery of 1860 was also legal!</p>
<p>As long as our officials continue to deprive peaceful persons of their right
 to use their time and earnings as they please, the officials will continue to
 lose a part of their own freedom along with the rest of us. As long as they continue
 to believe that freedom permits or obligates them to force their ideas upon peaceful
 persons who do not wish to participate, the system they have created enslaves
 them also. They obviously don't understand it, but they are somewhat like the
 man sitting on the chest of a person he has pinioned to the ground; as long as
 he sits there, he restricts his own freedom about as much as he restricts the
 freedom of his victim.</p>
<p>The officials who endorse and defend this system of legalized compulsions and
 prohibitions against peaceful persons are compelled to spend most of their time
 discussing ways and means - such as propaganda, secrecy, guile, deceit, laws,
 policemen, courts, jails, fines and so on - to force the rest of us to conform
 to their ideas and plans which we would reject if we were permitted a real choice
 in the matter. As long as they continue to enforce this mutually degrading process,
 they restrict and destroy the potentialities they have within themselves for
 advancement toward human understanding and some worthwhile ideal or goal. Sooner
 or later, the restrictions and compulsions they enforce against others will culminate
 in some type of an upheaval by an aroused and angry society which the officials
 can no longer control. Acts against human freedom - legal or illegal - have always
 worked that way. The fact that the intentions of most of our officials are so
 good only makes it sadder.</p>
<p>Some day we may realize that freedom is a relationship of <em>mutual</em> nonmolestation
 among persons wherein no person uses violence or the threat of violence to impose
 his will or viewpoint upon any other person. When enough of us understand this
 idea, we will begin to enjoy as much peace and prosperity as it is possible for
 us to have on earth.</p>
