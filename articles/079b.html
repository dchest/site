 <h2>The Historical Origins of Voluntaryism</h2>
 <h4>by James Luther Adams<br>
  From Number 79 - April 1996</h4>
</center>
<p>In modern history the first crucial affirmation of voluntaryism as
 an institutional phenomenon appeared in the demand of the sects for the separation
 of church and state. In England, for example, and then later in America, the
 intention was to do away with direct state control of the church and also to
 remove official ecclesiastical influence from the political realm-toward the
 end of creating a voluntary church. In the voluntary church, religious faith
 as well as membership was to be a matter of individual choice. The individual
 was no longer automatically to become a member of the church simply by reason
 of his being born in the territory. Moreover, he could choose not to be a member
 of a church. Nor was rejection of the established confession any longer to be
 considered a political offense or to deprive the unbeliever of the civil franchise.
 In rejecting state control, the church (and the theological seminary) were no
 longer to be supported by taxation. The objection to taxation in support of the
 church was two-fold: tax support, it was held, not only gave the state some right
 of control; it also represented a way of coercing the nonmember or the unbeliever
 to give financial support to the church. Freedom of choice for the individual
 brought with it another freedom, namely, the freedom to participate in the shaping
 of the policies of the church group of his choice. The rationale for this voluntaryism
 was worked out theologically by the sectarians of the sixteenth and seventeenth
 centuries, and more in terms of social and political theory by John Locke in
 the next century.</p>
 <p>From the point of view of a theory of associations, the demand for the separation
  of church and state and the emergence of the voluntary church represent the
  end of an old era and the beginning of a new one. The earlier era had been dominated
  by the ideal of &quot;Christendom,&quot; a unified structure of society in a
  church-state. In the new era the voluntary church, the free church, no longer
  supported by taxation, was to be self-sustaining; and it was to manage its own
  affairs. In the earlier era, kinship, caste, and restricted community groups
  had determined most of the interests and the forms of participation. In the
  new era these interests became segregated. In this respect the freedom of choice
  was increased. The divorce of church and state and the advent of freedom of
  religious association illustrate this type of increase in freedom of choice.</p>
 <p>In accord with this new conception of religious freedom and responsibility
  one must view the collection plate in the church service on Sunday as a symbol
  of the meaning of disestablishment and of voluntaryism. The collection plate
  symbolizes - indeed it in part also actualizes and institutionalizes - the view
  that the church as a corporate,body is a self-determinative group and that in
  giving financial support to the church the members affirm responsibility to
  participate in the shaping of the policies of the church. Thus the voluntary
  principle amounts to the principle of consent. One must add, however, that although
  the struggle for voluntaryism on a large scale in the church began over two
  hundred and fifty years ago, it was not achieved generally and officially in
  the United States until the nineteenth century - that is, apart from the colonies
  that from the beginning had had no establishment.</p>
 <p>The thrust toward the separation of church and state could succeed only by
  carrying through a severe struggle for freedom of association. Initially, the
  authorities who opposed it asserted that the health of society was threatened
  by the voluntary principle. They held that uniformity of belief was a prerequisite
  of a viable social order. As a separation of powers, voluntaryism was viewed
  as a wedge for chaos. In order to defend the unrestricted sovereignty of the
  commonwealth, Thomas Hobbes published in 1651 LEVIATHAN, the most cogent attack
  of the times upon the voluntary principle. In his view the church should be
  only an arm of the sovereign. Indeed, no association of any sort was to exist
  apart from state control. Therefore he spoke of voluntary associations, religious
  or secular, as &quot;worms in the entrails of the natural man&quot; (the integrated
  social whole). Analogous attacks upon the voluntary church came also from conservatives
  in the American colonies where establishment prevailed.</p>
 <p>Hobbes recognized that freedom of religious association would bring in its
  train the demand for other freedoms of association. His fears were fully justified.
  Indeed, with the emergence of this multiple conception of freedom of association
  a new conception of society came to birth - that of the pluralistic, the multi
  group society.</p>
