 <h2>Why I Would Not Vote Against Hitler</h2>
 <h4>by Wendy McElroy<br>
  Number 85 - Apr 1997</h4>
</center>
<p> At the last Liberty Conference, an intellectual brawl erupted during a panel
 discussion on terrorism. Since I consider electoral politics the milquetoast
 equivalent of terrorism, my opening statement was a condemnation of voting. My
 arguments were aimed at libertarians who consider themselves anarchists yet jump
 to their feet in ebullient applause upon hearing that a fellow libertarian wants
 to be a politician. In the two raucous hours that ensued, a question was posed:
 &quot;If you could have cast the deciding vote against Hitler, would you have
 done so?&quot; I replied, &quot;No, but I would have no moral objection to putting
 a bullet through his skull.&quot; In essence, I adopted a stronger line - a &quot;plumbline,&quot;
 as Benjamin Tucker phrased it - on eliminating the Hitler threat.</p>
<p>I consider such a bullet to be an act of self-defense in a manner that a ballot
 could never be. A bullet can be narrowly aimed at a deserving target; a ballot
 attacks innocent third parties who must endure the consequences of the politician
 I have assisted into a position of power over their lives. Whoever puts a man
 into a position of unjust power - that is, a position of political power - must
 share responsibility for every right he violates thereafter.</p>
<p>The question then shifted: &quot;If there had been no other strategies possible,
 would you have voted against Hitler?&quot; This postulated a fantasy world which
 canceled out one of the basic realities of existence: the constant presence of
 alternatives. In essence, the question became, &quot;If the fabric of reality
 were rewoven into a different pattern, would you still take the same moral stand?&quot;
 Since my morals are derived from my views about reality, it was not possible
 for me to answer this question. But my first response was to wonder what I would
 have been doing for the months and years that led to the momentous dilemma of
 whether to scratch an X beside Adolfs name. Or did I have no alternatives then
 either?</p>
<p>I can address only the reality in which I live and, in a world replete with
 alternatives, I would not vote for or against Hitler. Let me address a more fundamental
 question: What is the nature of the state? According to Max Weber, a state is
 an institution that claims a monopoly of force over a geographical area. It is
 a form of institutionalized power, and the first step in dissecting its essence
 is to analyze the defining terms &quot;power&quot; and &quot;institution.&quot;</p>
<p>Albert Jay Nock wrote of two sorts of power: social and state. By social power,
 he meant the amount of freedom individuals <em>actually</em> exercise over their
 lives - that is, the extent to which they can freely make such choices as where
 and how to live. By state power, he meant the actual amount of control the government
 exercises over its subjects' lives - that is, the extent to which it determines
 such choices as where and how people live. There is an inverse and antagonistic
 relationship between social and state power. One expands only at the expense
 of the other.</p>
<p>I stress the word &quot;actual&quot; because the power of the state does not
 rest on its size - the number of laws on the books or the extent of the territory
 it claims. A state's power rests on social conditions, such as whether people
 will obey its laws and how many resources it can command to enforce obedience.
 A key social condition is how legitimate the state is seen to be. For without
 the veil of legitimate authority, the people will not obey the state, and it
 will not long command the resources, such as taxes and manpower, that it needs
 to live.</p>
<p>In other words, freedom does not depend so much on repealing laws as weakening
 the state's authority. It does not depend - as political strategists expediently
 claim on persuading enough people to vote &quot;properly&quot; so that libertarians
 can occupy seats of political power and roll back legislation. Unfortunately,
 this process strengthens the institutional framework that produced the unjust
 laws in the first place: it strengthens the structure of state power by accepting
 its authority as a tool of change. But state authority can never strengthen social
 power.</p>
<p>This brings up the issue of institutional analysis. People apply the word &quot;institution&quot;
 to such wide-ranging concepts as &quot;the family,&quot; &quot;the free market,&quot;
 &quot;the church,&quot; and &quot;the state.&quot; An institution is any stable
 and widely-accepted mechanism for achieving social and political goals. To a
 great extent, these institutions function independently of the good or bad intentions
 of those who use them. For example, as long as everyone respects the rules of
 the free market, it functions as a mechanism of exchange. The same is true of
 the state. As long as everyone respects its rules - voting, going through state
 channels, obeying the law - it functions as a mechanism of social control.</p>
<p>F.A. Hayek popularized the notion of unintended consequences, observing that
 conscious acts often produce unforeseen results. This explains why good men who
 act through bad institutions will produce bad results. Good men acting through
 the state will strengthen its legitimacy and its institutional framework. They
 will weaken social power. Ultimately, whether or not they repeal any particular
 law becomes as irrelevant to producing freedom as their intentions.</p>
<p>So, returning to the question of voting for Hitler: purely for the sake of
 argument, I'll grant the possibility that I could morally cast a ballot. Yet
 even then, I would still refuse to vote against him. Why? Because the essential
 problem is not Hitler, but the institutional framework that allows a Hitler to
 grasp a monopoly on power. Without the state to back him up and an election to
 give him legitimized power, Hitler would have been, at most, the leader of some
 ragged thugs who mugged people in back alleys. Voting for or against Hitler would
 only strengthen the institutional framework that produced him - a framework that
 would produce another of his ilk in two seconds. Killing Hitler does less damage.
 But it - like voting - is an admission of utter defeat. Resorting to brute force
 means that all avenues of social power have been destroyed and I have been reduced
 to adopting the tactics of the state. Under tyranny, such violence might be justified
 as long as I could avoid harming innocent third parties. In these circumstances,
 however, voting could not be justified, because there is a third party. No one
 has the right to place one human being in a position of political power over
 another. A consistent libertarian can never authorize one human being to tax
 and control peaceful activities. And the state is no more than the institutionalized
 embodiment of this authorization.</p>
<p>You cannot help freedom or social power by bowing your head to Leviathan.</p>
