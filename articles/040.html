 <h2>Cultivate Your Own Garden: No Truck with Politics</h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  From Number 40 - October 1989</h4>
</center>
<p> Little has appeared in these pages of late concerning the Libertarian Party
 because I believe it is more important to focus on the positive side of voluntaryism
 than to critique methodologies which differ from our own philosophy. I believe
 that we need to put our time, intelligence, and energy into that which we wish
 to nurture. Criticism directed toward an erroneous view not only sometimes helps
 entrench the opposition, but lessens the focus on the efforts to make voluntaryism
 grow. However, remarks by
 <!--a HREF="literat.html#bob"-->
 Karl Hess
 <!--/a-->
 in the pages of <strong>Libertarian Party News</strong> (March/April 1989) deserve
 some comment. In an editorial titled, &quot;Our Goal Is Still Liberty,&quot;
 Hess writes:</p>
<blockquote><p> Ever since joining the Libertarian Party, years after declaring myself a small
 &quot;l&quot; libertarian, I have been concerned by the tendency of some in the
 party to insist that the party is, in fact, the movement. I have been equally
 concerned by the tendency of some outside of the party to insist that the party
 itself is a betrayal of the movement.</p>
<p> My own conviction is that neither case is valid.</p>
<p> The reasons for that have been stated many times in these editorial viewpoints.
 Rather than restate them, I want to move past them to what I hope is a practical
 suggestion to help us keep our eyes on the goal - liberty - rather than become
 fixated on one or another of the widely divergent ways of getting there.</p>
<p> Might we not, as individuals, make some concession to at least the possibility
 of cooperating toward that main goal even through we may disagree about a number
 of things along the way [?]</p>
<p> I offer a statement that would at least say we were friends: &quot;Sharing
 a belief that free markets and voluntary social arrangements can be the basis
 of a peaceful and prosperous world, we members of various liberty-seeking organizations
 agree, as individuals, to cooperate, share information, and, as appropriate and
 practical, mutually support, or at least not impede, our varied and often sharply
 different efforts to increase individual freedom.&quot;</p>
<p> Without for a moment suppressing our arguments, we might at least agree that
 we are headed in roughly the same direction and probably have less to fear from
 one another than from the great apparatus of state power that surrounds us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumption that we might agree &quot;that we are headed in roughly the
 same direction&quot; is one with which I must take issue. This is an attitude
 that was shared by many debaters of limited-government and no-govemment during
 the early days of the L.P. According to this view, all libertarians are passengers
 on the same train. The only difference between the advocates of limited-government,
 no-government, and the voluntaryists is that some get off sooner than others;
 but all are headed toward the same destination: liberty. However much this image
 might explain the difference between limited-government and no-government libertarians,
 it does not do justice to the voluntaryist view. At most, the image that I would
 suggest is that libertarians (of whatever stripe) and voluntaryists are at a
 common point of departure (we all face the present statist world). But the two
 groups board different trains, according to the methodology of social change
 that they choose to use. Since they are using the political means, the train
 of the political libertarians is travelling on the rails of statism, even if
 it seems to start off in the same direction as the other train. It will not long
 run parallel to the train boarded by the voluntaryists. The voluntaryists have
 no way of knowing where their journey will take them, and they are certain it
 has no end. The proper direction of their train can be only judged by the means
 used to propel it forward. There is no final &quot;stop&quot; or point of arrival
 since freedom and liberty are an on-going process. For the voluntaryists, the
 &quot;final&quot; form is in the means, not the ends.</p>
<p>While I do not wish to berate Hess's emphasis on toleration and co-operation
 among liberty-seeking individuals, one might also take issue with his reference
 to &quot;liberty-seeking organizations&quot; since most structures to achieve
 a public mission usually end up devoting more time to the structure than the
 mission. That theme was developed in the October 1988 <strong>Voluntaryist</strong>
 article, &quot;<a href="034.html">Does Freedom Need to Be Organized?</a>&quot; so there is no reason
 to belabor it here.</p>
<p>In addition, it is not a certain fact that voluntaryists would have less to
 fear from the political libertarians than from the current statists, were the
 former to gain power. If the &quot;law&quot; is to be respected and enforced
 and not disobeyed (an attitude which political libertarians must necessarily
 cultivate), then it is quite likely libertarians will use that power not only
 to support themselves but to crack down on the opposition. George Smith argued
 this point persuasively In <strong>The New Libertarian Weekly</strong> (October
 31, 1976) in his satirical essay, &quot;Victory Speech of the Libertarian Party
 President-Elect, 1984.&quot; Also the entire history of the European anarchist
 movement (especially the brutal suppression of the Russian anarchist movement
 by the Bolsheviks, and the treatment of the anarchists during the Spanish Civil
 War) lends weight to this argument (see <!--a HREF="6nbnb.html"-->Voluntaryism in the European Anarchist
 Tradition<!--/a--> in <!--a HREF="literat.html"-->Neither Bullets Nor Ballots<!--/a-->). As Errico Malatesta, the Italian anarchist,
 wrote in 1932:</p>
<blockquote><p> The primary concern of every government is to ensure its continuance in power,
 irrespective of the men who form it. If they are bad, they want to remain in
 power in order to enrich themselves and to satisfy their lust for authority;
 and if they are honest and sincere they believe it is their duty to remain in
 power for the people. ...The anarchists... could never, even if they were strong
 enough, form a government without contradicting themselves and repudiating their
 entire doctrine; and, should they do so, it would be no different from any other
 government; perhaps it would even be worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Informed common sense says that &quot;political gains without philosophical
 understanding are potentially short-lived.&quot; This may be better understood
 if we realize that we should focus on the question: &quot;How do we prevent another
 State from taking the place of the one we already have?&quot; rather than concentrating
 on the short-term problem (which most libertarians address) of &quot;How do we
 get rid of the current State?&quot; How can people be weaned from the State by
 the use of electoral politics? If the political method is proper to remove the
 State, as those active in the L.P. believe, then would it not be proper to re-introduce
 a new State, if the majority of voters were to desire it? The point is that there
 must be a sufficient respect and understanding for freedom and liberty in a given
 social community before those ideals can be realized, and if that respect and
 understanding already exist (or are brought into existence) - there is no reason
 to capture the seats of political power in order to disband the State. You attack
 evil at its roots by not supporting it. Just as voluntaryism occurs naturally
 if no one does anything to stop it, so will the State gradually disappear when
 those who oppose it stop supporting it. (This is not to overlook the fact that
 a certain &quot;critical mass&quot; of numbers must be reached before this can
 happen.)</p>
<p>The only thing that the individual can do &quot;is to present society with
 'one improved unit'.&quot; As Albert Jay Nock put it,</p>
<blockquote><p> &quot;[A]ges of experience testify that the only way society can be improved
 is by the individualist method ... ; that is, the method of each 'one' doing
 his very best to improve 'one'.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the &quot;quiet&quot; or &quot;patient&quot; way of changing society
 because it concentrates upon bettering the character of men and women as individuals.
 As the individual units change, the improvement of society will take care of
 itself. In other words, <strong>&quot;If one takes care of the means, the end
 will take care of itself.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>There is no question that this method is extremely difficult, since most of
 us realize what force of intellect and force of character are required just to
 improve ourselves. &quot;it is easy to prescribe improvement of others; it is
 easy to organize something, to institutionalize this-or-that, to pass laws, multiply
 bureaucratic agencies, form pressure-groups, start revolutions, change forms
 of government, tinker at political theory. The fact that these expedients have
 been tried unsuccessfully in every conceivable combination for six thousand years
 has not noticeably impaired a credulous intelligent willingness to keep on trying
 them again and again.&quot; There is no guarantee that the voluntaryist method
 will be successful - but because each individual concentrates on himself and
 not others, it is worth-while, profitable, and self-satisfying even if it does
 not come to fruition in the short-run or during one's lifetime. The time spent
 on building a better, stronger you, on developing your vocational and avocational
 skills, your family, and your marriage makes you a better person regardless of
 outside circumstances. In short, time spent cultivating your own garden is always
 profitable and moral. Trying to cultivate another's garden is trespass, (unless
 you are first invited to enter) and of necessity lessens the amount of time you
 can spend on your own self-improvement.</p>
<p>Libertarians engaged in electoral politics are saying (though they might not
 admit it) that the ends justifies the means. This has always been a common excuse
 for electoral activity and for supporting the existing political system. Emma
 Goldman laid this error to rest when she wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p> There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one
 thing, while methods and tactics are another. This conception is a potent menace
 to social regeneration. All human experience teaches that means cannot be separated
 from the ultimate aims. The means employed become, through individual habit and
 social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose; they modify it, and presently
 the aims and means become identical. ... The whole history of man is continuous
 proof of the maxim that to divest one's methods of ethical concepts is to sink
 into the depths of utter demoralization.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why I believe that political methods are inherently self-defeating
 and inconsistent with voluntaryism. Such methodologies carry the seeds of their
 own destruction. Though Karl Hess and other supporters of the Libertarian Party
 may claim to support liberty, I honestly believe they are mistaken. Their tickets
 may say &quot;Destination-liberty,&quot; but I sincerely doubt that their train
 is headed in that direction. </p>
