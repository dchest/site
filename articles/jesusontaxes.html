 <h2>Jesus on Taxes</h2><br>
<h4>Excerpted
from www.jesus-on-taxes.com (website no longer available) (pages 8-9).

<p>
 This essay contains three hypotheses. The primary thesis is that,
contrary to what most people have been led to believe by their church
and government leaders, Jesus did not condone taxation nor endorse the
concept of the nation-state when he said 'render unto Caesar therefore
the things which are Caesar's." If the essay succeeds in persuading
some readers of that one point, we are confident those who read it
with an open mind will be persuaded, our research, writing and prayers
will be vindicated.
<p>
The second hypothesis is this: Jesus taught and lived by principles
diametrically opposed to government and taxes. If that is true, then
those who would live their lives according to the principles Jesus
taught will neither collect, receive, nor voluntarily pay taxes, nor
be involved with the state in any way that can possibly be avoided.
<p>
Finally, although Jesus died of his own volition in compliance with
his Father's will in order to save mankind from sin, which may be the
most important fact to know about Jesus, our third hypothesis holds
that it is likely and eminently logical to believe that Pontius Pilate
crucified Jesus for teaching his disciples that taxation is condemned
by God's commandment, Thou shalt not steal. Pilate obviously didn't
kill Jesus to save mankind from sin, although Jesus died for that
purpose. Did he die to save us from taxes? If, as this essay shows,
taxes are sinful because they violate God's Commandment, it follows as
night follows day that indeed he did.
