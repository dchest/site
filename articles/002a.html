<h2>The Ethics of Voting - Part II</h2>
<h4>by George H. Smith</h4>
</center>

<h3>3. Institutional Analysis</h3>

<p>I have argued that institutional analysis is essential not only to the
voluntaryist critique of electoral voting, but to anarchist theory
generally. Anarchism combines the nonaggression principle with an
institutional view of the State, resulting in the principled rejection
of the State on libertarian grounds. For the concept of "anarchism" to
be meaningful, the concept of the "State" must also be meaningful.
Anarchism presupposes that the State can be defined in theory and
identified in practice. The State must possess distinctive features
which enable us to differentiate it from other kinds of human
association; and there must be criteria by which we can distinguish
members from nonmembers (a significant issue, as we shall see).</p>

<p>In addition, the anarchist rejection of the State is usually
based on moral arguments. This carries institutional analysis from the
descriptive realm to the normative realm, for we are now concerned with
how moral evaluation applies within an institutional framework. If, as
anarchists claim, the State is invasive per se and therefore inherently
unjust, then what does this moral condemnation of an institution imply
concerning those individuals who voluntarily become "members" of the
State? Few anarchists restrict liability for the State's criminal acts
to direct aggressors only, i.e., to law enforcement personnel. Few
anarchists exonerate dictators because they do not personally enforce
their decrees. Indeed, anarchists often impute greatest liability to
the highest levels of political decision-making (presidents,
legislators, etc.), even though these levels are far removed from
physical enforcement. (There were more condemnations of President
Johnson during the Vietnam War than of individual bomber pilots.) This
kind of moral analysis is understandable only within an institutional
framework, where individuals are assessed according to their role in
sustaining and implementing State injustice, however distant they may
be from actual enforcement. Individual acts, in other words, are not
judged in isolation, but within a broader context. Inevitably, as, I
argued in Part One, this will entail some theory of vicarious
liability. Anarchists must present a theory to explain how persons
other than direct aggressors can be held accountable for criminal acts.
We must explain, moreover, where liability ends and why.</p>

<p>These are not easy problems to solve, and they have been
virtually ignored in libertarian literature, The result has been some
rather wide gaps in anarchist theory, in which political anarchists
have found it convenient to hide when under attack. When institutional
analysis is used against the political anarchist, he will often object
to this procedure as such (rather than to its particular application in
his case) on the ground that institutional analysis, whether
descriptive or normative, violates the time-honored libertarian
principles of methodological individualism, value subjectivism,
individual responsibility, and so forth. The political anarchist, of
course, does not examine what these kamikaze arguments would do to his
own profession of anarchism. He does not care to explain how, if
institutional analysis is ruled out of court, it is possible even to
state coherently what anarchism is, much less defend it. Even
anarchists are afflicted with a strange blindness when they stoop to
defend political power.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to argue for the use of institutional
analysis within anarchist theory. I submit that it is already used
extensively by political anarchists and voluntaryists alike, but that
it usually lurks in the shadows, as if we are embarrassed to expose it
to the light of day. It has a suspicious ancestry, this institutional
analysis. It smacks of sociology, collectivism, holism, and other
things generally repugnant to libertarians. Fear of contamination leads
to a failure of nerve — there is, after all, the haunting possibility
that anarchism itself will collapse if it rests on institutional
analysis — so we go merrily about denouncing the "State" without
specifying precisely which individuals constitute the State or how it
is possible to pass moral judgment on an institution. (We have been
somewhat fortunate that minarchist critics of anarchism have generally
overlooked these vulnerable spots — but it is possible that they, too,
succumb to institutional analysis.)</p>

<h3>4. Describing Institutions</h3>

<p>It is important to understand that institutional analysis, as
here employed, does not contradict methodological individualism. It
does not deny that only individuals act or that social phenomena are
reducible to individual actions. One can speak meaningfully of
institutions, associations, organizations, and so forth, without
implying that these social phenomena enjoy an existence apart from
individuals. Methodological individualists are not required to purge
their vocabulary of terms like "family," "church," "state," and
"corporation."</p>

<p>Indeed, staunch methodological individualists have used
institutional analysis extensively as an explanatory tool. This is
evident among Austrian economists who, despite their commitment to
methodological individualism and value subjectivism, eagerly analyze
free-market institutions (such as money) that result from human action
but not from human design. "Institution," an elusive term at best, is
used here in a broad sense to designate a widely recognized and
stabilized method of pursuing a social activity (exchange, in the case
of money). It is possible conceptually to isolate some feature of
social interaction and to study it abstracted from the particular
individuals involved. Individual actors are presupposed in this
procedure, but their specific identities are irrelevant to the outcome.
Individual actors, within institutional analysis, are anonymous. The
reason for this, as F.A. Hayek has argued, is because intentional
actions have unintended consequences.
</p><blockquote>"The problems which (the social sciences) try to
answer arise only in so far as the conscious action of many men produce
undesigned results, in so far as regularities are observed which are
not the result of anybody's design. If social phenomena showed no order
except in so far as they were consciously designed, there would indeed
be no room for theoretical sciences of society and there would be, as
is often argued, only problems of psychology. It is only in so far as
some sort of order arises as a result of individual action but without
being designed by any individual that a problem is raised which demands
a theoretical explanation."
<br> (The Counter-Revolution of Science, Free Press, 1955, p. 39.)</blockquote>
<p>It is possible to interpret Hayek to mean that only institutions
which are themselves the product of spontaneous order are the proper
subject of social theory. This would rule out designed institutions
(often called associations), such as business organizations, fraternal
clubs, and (most relevant to our purpose) modern States. But even these
designed institutions exhibit many unintended consequences internally.
An automobile factory is designed; its internal division of labor does
not emerge spontaneously. The overall purpose guiding the design of an
automobile factory is the efficient production of cars. But this may
not be the purpose of many (or even most) factory workers. The
machinist, the welder, the fitter, the warehouse foreman — these
specialized roles can be filled even if the individuals concerned know
or care very little about the overall product to which their labor
contributes. The structure of a factory is designed, so we may speak of
a factory's "purpose" (i.e., the purpose of its designers). Yet the
furtherance of this purpose may, from the perspective of the individual
worker, be unintended. This is why it is perfectly correct to say that
an individual (the factory worker) may contribute unintentionally to an
institutional end (the production of cars).</p>

<p>The need for specialization leads to a division of labor, and
this may be undesigned (as in society generally) or designed (as in
business organizations). The division of labor in designed institutions
(which I shall hereafter refer to as "associations") leads to the
institutionalization of labor or "roles," to use a term common among
sociologists. If a factory needs another welder, it seeks out a
qualified individual to fill that role. It is possible to discuss the
importance of the welder role in the overall production process without
referring to any specific welder. We know, of course, that the
disembodied role of welder does not actually weld anything; we always
presuppose a flesh-and-blood human being who functions in that
capacity. But the specific identity of the welder (his religion,
personal characteristics, etc.) and his personal intentions (why he
took the job) are immaterial to the successful accomplishment of the
institutional end, so long as the welder satisfies the requirements of
the role (i.e., "does his job"). This is what I mean when I say that
the individual functioning in a role is presupposed but anonymous.</p>

<p>An institutional analysis of an automobile factory would
examine roles within the factory, the efficient ordering of roles in
relation to each other (which job should be done first? where is the
best location within the plant for a particular job?), and the relation
of these roles to the desired outcome (does the addition of a tape deck
as standard equipment add too much to the car's price?). We can speak
meaningfully of the production process, the production result , and the
contribution of roles to both process and result — even if these are
unintended from the standpoint of individual workers. The welder may
insist that his intention is to contribute to the building of boats —
he may adamantly denounce cars as dangerous and swear his eternal
hostility to them — but insofar as he fulfills the institutional role
of automobile welder, we will insist that he does, in fact, contribute
to the building of cars. This may be an unintended consequence of his
actions, but it is a consequence nonetheless. (And we should keep in
mind that "unintended" does not mean "unforeseeable.")</p>

<p>Thus, institutional analysis examines individual actions not in
isolation, but within the broader context of institutional roles. We
can give a purely physical description of the welder's actions; this is
one kind of description. We can also give an institutional description
of the welder's actions; this is another kind of description — one that
attempts to link the isolated action to a broader chain of actions
performed by others within an association.</p>

<p>Many common terms cannot be grasped using physical
descriptions. Such terms, including many political terms, must be
defined institutionally. They can be understood only by relating them
to the roles and procedures of an association. "Voting" is a pertinent
example. Suppose that, in preparation for election day, I construct a
"voting booth" in my backyard that is physically identical (within
reason) to authorized voting booths located around the city. On
election day I enter my booth and pull the appropriate levers. But have
I voted? Obviously not. At most I have expressed a preference in a
rather bizarre fashion. Unless a voting booth is authorized by the
State, whatever goes on in the booth is not described as voting. The
physical similarity between my action and real voting is irrelevant.
What counts is the institutional framework in which the physical
activity occurs. (We shall return to this in more detail in a later
installment.)</p>

<p>Institutional analysis also permits us to understand the
continuity of associations. The U.S. State, since is formal inception
in 1789 (ratification of the Constitution), has undergone many
turnovers in personnel. Moreover, it has expanded territorially and has
experienced tremendous growth in its laws, regulations, and

bureaucracy. But we still refer to it as the same State, and correctly
so. This is because the basic structure of the State, including its
Constitution, has remained fundamentally unchanged.</p>

<p>Before applying institutional analysis (descriptive) to the
State in more detail, let us anticipate somewhat and touch on a problem
created for ethical theory by institutional analysis.</p>

<h3>5. Division of Labor and Moral Responsibility</h3>

<p>The division of labor within associations creates an interesting
and often frustrating problem of determining responsibility. We see
this in modern States which, as they expand the range and intensity of
their political power, have evolved complex and highly specialized
internal functions. Attributing responsibility is especially difficult
in democratic States, where locating the center(s) of power keeps
political "scientists" busy arguing with each other. On the one side
are defenders of "elite" theories, who see political power resting in
the hands of a small group, or class. This class may be defined
economically (e.g., Marxists) or politically (e.g., followers of Mosca
and Pareto). On the other side are democratic pluralists (e.g., Robert
Dahl) who believe there are many foci of power distributed throughout a
democratic State. And there are defenders of various shades in between.
(We may be thankful that few sophisticated theorists maintain any
longer that political power rests in the hands of "the people.")</p>

<p>Ralf Dahrendorf addresses the problem of responsibility and its
connection to the division of labor in Class and Class Conflict in
Industrial Society (Stanford, 1959, p. 297). "Like the division of
labor in industrial production," Dahrendorf notes, the division of
labor in political power "has led to the creation of numerous
specialist positions, every one of which bears but slight traces of the
process of which it is a part."</p>

<p><blockquote>"Who produces the car in an automobile factory? The
director? The fitter? The foreman? The typist? Every one of these
questions has to be answered in the negative, and one might therefore
be tempted to conclude that nobody produces the car at all. Yet the car
is being produced, and we can certainly identify people who do not
participate in its production."</blockquote></p>

<p>Dahrendorf applies this same reasoning to the pinpointing of responsibility in a bureaucracy:
</p>

<blockquote>
"Nobody in particular seems to exercise 'the authority' and yet
authority is exercised, and we can identify people who do not
participate in its exercise. Thus the superficial impression of
subordination in many minor bureaucratic roles must not deceive us. All
bureaucratic roles are defined with reference to the total process of
the exercise of authority to which they contribute to whatever small
extent."
</blockquote>
<p>Dahrendorf makes a point of great significance. It may be impossible
in some cases to attribute exact responsibility for the exercise of
political power. But the difficulty in apportioning responsibility
within an association (the State, in this case) does not hinder our
ability to separate those who are responsible from those who are not.
We can discriminate, in other words, between association members and
nonmembers. We can distinguish factory workers from nonworkers.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can usually distinguish members of the State from
nonmembers. The President is obviously a member of the State; the
factory worker is not. Between these extremes there are shades of gray.
What about the executives of a munitions firm that survives entirely
from government contracts? What about a mail carrier for the United
States Postal Service? Such examples could be multiplied endlessly, and
they pose even more problems when we examine totalitarian governments
where the private sector is virtually nonexistent (except for the black
market).</p>

<p>I shall address some of these problems at a later time. For now
we should recognize that the presence of gray does not negate the
existence of black and white. To ascertain a precise cutoff point may
be troublesome, but this does not mean that the extremes are any less
clear. Since the dispute within libertarianism concerns the election of
libertarians to significant political offices at various levels, the
determination of a cutoff point is not crucial to this analysis. We
must first decide whether anarchists can in good conscience become
overt members of the State congressmen, etc.); then we can attempt to
clear up the fuzzy areas (working for the post office, state
universities, etc.).</p>

<h3>6. The Modern State</h3>

<p>"To really understand the State," wrote the anarchist Peter
Kropotkin, one must "study it in its historical development" (The
State: Its Historic Role, Haldeman-Julius, 1947, p. 7). This historical
perspective teaches us that the State is a designed institution; it was
forcibly imposed to accomplish specific objectives. By understanding
these objectives, which have since become institutionalized, we are
better able to understand the structure and internal functioning of
States existing today. When we examine the division of labor within a
factory, it helps to know what the factory was designed to produce.
Similarly, when we examine the State, it is vital to know the
purpose(s) that generated this complex and massive association. States
have varied considerably in their structure and jurisdiction, but all
of them fit the description by Franz Oppenheimer in The State
(Vanguard, 1926). Oppenheimer distinguishes two basic methods of
acquiring wealth: the economic means (labor and voluntary exchange) and
the political means ("the unrequited appropriation of the labor of
others"). This leads to a succinct description: "The state is an
organization of the political means" (p. 27).</p>

<p>The State, for Oppenheimer, is organized theft — a method of
systematic plunder. This is true but incomplete. The State is a union
of thieves, but not all such unions are States. State theft is
distinguished by being legitimized, i.e., its coercive actions are
generally regarded by the subject population as morally and/or legally
proper. This feature is emphasized by Max Weber in his classic
discussion of the modern State:
</p><blockquote>"A ruling organization will be called 'political'
insofar as its existence and order is continuously safeguarded within a
given territorial area by the threat and application of physical force
on the part of the administrative staff. A compulsory political
organization with continuous operations will be called a 'state'
insofar as its administrative staff successfully upholds the claim to
the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force in the enforcement
of Its order"
<br> (Economy and Society, Univ. of California Press, 1978, 1, p. 54).</blockquote>

<p>This harmonizes with the notion of the State employed by
libertarians in the debate between minarchism and anarchism. For
example, Ayn Rand — perhaps the foremost proponent of minarchism —
defines "government" as "an institution that holds the exclusive power
to enforce certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area
" (The Virtue of Selfishness, New American Library, p. 107).</p>

<p>"A given geographical area — this allusion to territorial
sovereignty recurs throughout the libertarian debates on the legitimacy
of government. Although this is important, it is usually overlooked
that territorial jurisdiction is a feature not of all States (or
governments) throughout history, but of what historians refer to as
"the modern State." This does not mean that such States did not exist
before the modern era: the ancient Greek city-states exercised
territorial sovereignty, as did the Han Empire of China and the Roman
Empire. But the modern States of Western Europe, which were to become
models of State-building throughout the world (England and France were
especially influential), were not extensions of the ancient world; they
developed from the successful, and often brutal, centralization of
power by monarchs during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. (The
origin of this trend can be traced back even further — perhaps to 1100,
according to Joseph Strayer, On the Medieval Origins of the Modem
State, Princeton, 1970.)</p>

<p>Historians generally regard the sixteenth century as pivotal in
the development of the modern State. It was during this period that
monarchs began to dominate rival claimants to power (especially the
nobility and church). The march to territorial sovereignty accelerated
its bloody pace. "The state-makers," as Charles Tilly notes, "only
imposed their wills on the populace through centuries of ruthless
effort."
</p><blockquote>"The effort took many forms: creating distinct staffs
dependent on the crown and loyal to it; making those staffs (armies and
bureaucrats alike) reliable, effective instruments of policy; blending
coercion, co-optation and legitimation as means of guaranteeing the
acquiescence of different segments of the populations; acquiring sound
information about the country, its people and its resources; promoting
economic activities which would free or create resources for the use of
the state . . . Ultimately, the people paid"
<br> (The Formation of National States in Western Europe, ed. Charles Tilly, Princeton, 1975, p. 24)</blockquote>
<p>The American State was also designed, though under different
conditions than those in Europe. As part of the British Empire, the
colonies were subject to colonial administration. Under the aegis of
Robert Walpole, however, the colonies enjoyed a lengthy period of
"salutary neglect" wherein mercantilist regulations were loosely
enforced, if at all. When this lax policy ended in 1763 — owing to the
crushing financial burden incurred by Britain during the Seven Years
War — the English found enforcement to be extremely difficult. Lax
policies, plus the difficulty of governing from thousands of miles
away, had permitted the colonists to evolve their own systems of local
government which hindered centralization. A system of "competing
governments" arose which prevented either side from attaining complete
domination.</p>

<p>This changed with the successful completion of the American
Revolution. Revolutions, however just, have unintended consequences of
considerable magnitude. Two consequences of the American Revolution are
important here: first, debts incurred during the war convinced many of
the need for a centralized government with taxing power; second, with
the British eliminated, there was no effective brake on the formation
of a national State. The major competitor had been kicked out, and the
field was clear for those who desired a State, provided it was not the
British State.</p>

<p>But a new State (especially one born in revolution against
monarchy) faced the considerable problem of legitimacy. A solution was
readily found in a written Constitution authorized by "the people." (We
needn't examine that fraud here.) Thus came into being one of the first
modern "power maps" or "manifestoes of nationalism," to use the apt
phrases of Ivo Duchacek (Power Maps: Comparative Politics of
Constitutions, American Bibliographic Center, 1973).</p>

<p>The national government maintained its territorial sovereignty
(over a growing amount of territory) without serious internal challenge
until the Civil War. Sectional conflict between the North and South had
erupted long before this, of course, but the political dominance of the
Democratic Party (which enjoyed support from both sides) prevented an
open break. This unified support disintegrated, however, in the 1850s,
largely thanks to Stephen Douglas and his support of the
Kansas-Nebraska Act.</p>

<p>A badly divided Democratic Party lost the presidency to the
Republicans in 1860; and the deep South seceded in response to the
ascension of a sectional candidate to the presidency. Lincoln, an
ex-Whig, was thoroughly imbued with nationalist doctrines; and this
president who would not have made war to liberate slaves was —
nonetheless willing to wage war in order to "preserve the union."
("Secession," as Lincoln correctly said, "is the essence of anarchy.")
The Fort Sumter incident provoked other southern states to join the
Confederacy, and thus began the bloodiest conflict in American history.
Some 600,000 people lost their lives in this titanic struggle between
two States, each attempting to establish sovereignty. The most
significant chapter in American State-building was written with the
blood of thousands.</p>

<p>We see that, however modern States differ in the details of
their origin, and however they differ in the extent of their power, all
share a common design. All were explicitly intended to establish
territorial sovereignty. All insist that they are the final arbiters in
matters pertaining to law within a given geographical area. (The scope
of the law varies dramatically, of. course, from State to State.) All
States proclaim compulsory jurisdiction : a person is regarded as
subject to the State, with or without his consent, as long as he
resides in or is passing through a certain area (land, sea, or air).
This territorial sovereignty is the foundation of all other State
activities.</p>

<p>This historical digression is an important ingredient in
developing an institutional analysis of the State. The State is a
designed institution, forcibly imposed. State-builders had specific
objectives in mind, foremost of which was to secure territorial
sovereignty. The internal structure of the State was dictated (and
continues its evolution today) with sovereignty foremost in mind.
Virtually all functions of government — a standing army, an internal
police, a monopolistic judiciary, a ruthless taxing power, public
schools, etc. — may be seen as supports for the monopolization of
power.</p>

<p>After we understand the purpose for which the State was
designed, we are able to undertake an institutional analysis similar to
the automobile factory discussed earlier. There we discussed how the
overall product (the car) may be unintended from the perspective of
specialized workers. We also examined the importance of roles in the
production process. It is thus possible to refer to an institutional
product and process being integral to the factory's structure. The
worker, in filling a role (doing his job), participates in the process
and contributes to the product, quite apart from his personal
intentions and goals.</p>

<p>Similarly, we may examine the "State-factory," the institution
designed to monopolize power and thereby sustain territorial
sovereignty. Sovereignty is the "product" of this association (or the
most fundamental among many); a monopoly on legitimized coercion is the
"process." But roles in the State apparatus, like roles in the factory,
need human beings to fill them. There are increasing specialization and
division of labor as the State expands its power and jurisdiction. Many
of the individuals in specialized roles may have little knowledge of,
or interest in, the institutionalized process and product to which
their labor contributes. Their contribution, in this sense, may be
unintended. (But, to repeat an earlier point, unintended does not mean
unforeseeable.)</p>

<p>This is what I mean by institutional analysis. And this is what
I believe to be implicit throughout much of the writing by libertarian
anarchists. I have attempted to show what it means to say that an
anarchist politician contributes to State injustice merely by filling a
role (i.e., holding political office). I have attempted to show why the
intentions of the politician are irrelevant to the process and product
of the "State-factory" he has willingly joined. Political offices are
indispensable roles in the State apparatus; and I submit that anyone
who fills these roles contributes, however inadvertently, to the State
process (monopoly of power) and product (sovereignty). The continuance
of State power rests, not on the intentions of those who hold political
offices, but on the complex structure of the State apparatus, each part
of which contributes to the maintenance of State supremacy.</p>

<p>Thus the anarchist politician is like the auto worker who
claims to be building a boat, and who professes surprise when a car
comes out anyway against his wishes. And is he to blame? Not at all.
True, he did voluntarily take on a job at an auto factory. True, he did
get paid for it. True, he did show up for work and do the things that
an auto worker is supposed to do. But what do such inconvenient facts
count against his desire to build a boat?</p>

<p>And so our political anarchist. He gets a job with a political
power factory and expects to produce freedom. He may even claim to be a
clever saboteur (forgetting that authentic saboteurs never announce the
fact). He goes to work, does political things (votes, etc.), receives a
State salary, and even swears allegiance to the State. Because of this
the voluntaryist suggests that he is in fact contributing to State
power, despite his best intentions.</p>
