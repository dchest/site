 <h2>Highway Tax vs. Poll Tax: Some Thoreau Tax Trivia</h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  From Number 71 - December 1994</h4>
</center>
<p>In the August 1994 issue of <strong>The Voluntaryist</strong>, I wrote about
 Charles Lane, a friend and confidant of Henry David Thoreau. After reviewing
 my files about Lane and Thoreau, which have accumulated over the years, I found
 some new material which I thought would be interesting to the readers of this
 newsletter. </p>
<p>The story of Thoreau's night in jail is told in his essay &quot;On the Duty
 of Civil Disobedience.&quot; This well-known event took place on the evening
 of July 23 or 24th, 1846 at Concord, Massachusetts. Few people realize that Thoreau's
 arrest and imprisonment were unnecessary and illegal. Walter Harding was the
 first that I know of to point this out in his article &quot;Thoreau In Jail,&quot;
 appearing in the August 1975 issue of AMERICAN HERITAGE. </p>
<p>&quot;The poll, or capitation, tax was a standard source of revenue in colonial
 times,&quot; and even Thoreau's &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; at Walden Pond would
 not allow him to escape the tax. The poll tax was a tax on one's person, and
 could only be avoided by living beyond the pale of &quot;civilized&quot; government.
 John C. Broderick described its legal basis in his article on &quot;Thoreau,
 Alcott, And The Poll Tax&quot; [53 STUDIES IN PHILOLOGY (1956), pp. 612-626].
 The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 re-affirmed the constitutionality of such
 a tax and &quot;provided that 'the public charges of government' should be assessed&quot;
 on each male citizen sixteen years or older (except those &quot;who by reason
 of age, infirmity, and poverty, may in the judgment of the assesors be unable
 to contribute toward the public charges.&quot;) [Mass. Constitution, chap. I,
 sec. I, art. IV]. The poll tax was to be assessed upon &quot;each taxable person
 in the town, where he shall be an inhabitant on the first day of May in each
 year.&quot; Minors' poll taxes were to be assessed upon parents or guardians.
 During the mid-1840s, the maximum amount of any such tax was $1.50. </p>
<p>The Massachusetts Revised Statutes of 1836 (Title III, chap. 7, secs. 1, 5,
 6, 17, 27, 29; chap. 8 sec. 11) provided the authority by which the town of Concord
 assessed and collected the poll tax. Town assessors imposed the tax, which was
 then recorded in an annual manuscript account book. The town government itself
 did not directly collect the tax. Tax collections for Concord were put out on
 bid. &quot;For 1841 Orin Wilson had been appointed tax-collector on the basis
 of his bid of one cent on the dollar. However, Wilson declined to serve, and
 James P. Brown, the collector of the preceding year, was appointed in his place
 at the higher rate of one and three-fourths cents on the dollar. In 1842 Samuel
 Staples was appointed collector at the rate of one cent. Staples served for four
 years, charging more each year, until 1845, when he received one and one-half
 cents. For 1846 Addison G. Fay was appointed at one and one-fourth cent.&quot;
 When Staples retired in early 1846, the last year of taxes that he would have
 been responsible for was 1845. Since &quot;the tax collector was responsible
 to the town for the amount authorized by the assessors,&quot; it was natural
 that Staples would have made every effort to collect all taxes due him. He had
 to pay the town its taxes, whether he collected them or not. Thus his efforts
 to complete his tax-collections led to Thoreau's imprisonment. </p>
<p>Thoreau's first legal encounter with the political authorities in Massachusetts
 took place in 1838, when he turned twenty-one. The State demanded that he pay
 the one dollar ministerial tax, in support of a clergyman &quot;whose preaching
 my father attended but never I myself.&quot; The tax was paid by another (much
 as his contested poll tax was paid), probably by one of his aunts. In order to
 avoid the ministerial tax in the future, Thoreau had to execute what was known
 as a &quot;certificate bow,&quot; an affidavit attesting that he was not a member
 of the church. It is interesting to note that Thoreau had to assert his non-membership,
 rather than the church having to prove his membership in the congregation. </p>
<p>Although it is presumed that Thoreau's poll taxes as a minor were paid by his
 father, his name next occurs &quot;in the Concord tax books in 1839 when he is
 charged one dollar and fifty cents for the town and county poll tax. He is charged
 the same amount throughout the 1840s except for 1843 when his name fails to appear
 because of his seven-month residence in New York.&quot; John C. Broderick presents
 evidence that Thoreau paid his poll tax for 1839, 1840, and 1841, and began resisting
 the poll tax after it was assessed for the year 1842. His friend, Bronson Alcott,
 was arrested on January 17, 1843 for non-payment of his own 1842 poll tax. The
 tax was paid by Samuel Hoar, Concord's &quot;leading citizen, who thought Alcott's
 protest a blot on the town's&quot; reputation. Slightly less than a year later,
 in mid-December 1843, Charles Lane was similarly detained and arrested until
 someone paid his 1842 poll tax. </p>
<p>The historical evidence suggests that non-payment of poll taxes was fairly
 common in Massachusetts, especially during the decade of the 1830s. According
 to the manuscript accounts in the Concord Free Public Library some &quot;seventy-three
 persons failed to pay their taxes for 1834-1835, of whom forty-six were liable
 only for the poll tax.&quot; Instructions found in these tax books authorized
 the tax-collector to &quot;distrain the good or chattels&quot; of any person
 who &quot;shall refuse or neglect to pay the sum he is assessed.&quot; And &quot;for
 the want of goods and chattels whereon to make distress&quot; the collector is
 instructed to &quot;take the body of such so refusing and neglecting and him
 to commit unto the common goal [sic] of the Country [sic], there to remain until
 he pay the same, or such part thereof as shall not be abated by the assessors.&quot;
 Similar guidelines were provided in state legislation in Chapter 8 of the Revised
 Statutes of 1836: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 Sect. 7. If any person shall refuse or neglect to pay his [poll] tax, the collector
 shall levy the same by distress and sale of his goods, .... </p>
<p>Sect. 8. The collector shall keep the goods distrained, at the expense of the
 owner, for the space of four days, at the least, and shall, within seven days
 after the seizure, sell the same by public auction, .... </p>
<p>Sec. 11. If the collector cannot find sufficient goods, upon which it may be
 levied, he may take the body of such person and commit him to prison, there to
 remain, until he shall pay the tax and charges of commitment and imprisonment
 or shall be discharged by order of law. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Walter Harding suggests that both Staples, the tax-collector, and Thoreau were
 probably unaware of the provisions of the statute, because Thoreau owned a collection
 of books, numbering more than a hundred and forty volumes. Thoreau's library
 could have been distrained and auctioned for more than the amount of poll tax
 he owed. Although Thoreau could have avoided arrest by telling Staples to seize
 his books, it may have been easier for Staples to imprison Thoreau than to go
 through the distraint and auction procedures. In any case, Thoreau was probably
 not interested in avoiding arrest because the whole idea of his act of civil
 disobedience was &quot;to protest by not paying his tax, rather than to pay the
 tax&quot; even &quot;under protest.&quot; </p>
<p>Thoreau makes one interesting comment about taxes in his essay on civil disobedience.
 He wrote that he wished to never &quot;rely on the protection of the State,&quot;
 and refused to tend it his allegiance. Despite this, he &quot;never declined
 paying the highway tax, because I am as desirous of being a good neighbor as
 I am of being a bad subject; .&quot; While he wins points for wanting to be a
 good neighbor, as voluntaryists we need to call the consistency of his reasoning
 in to question. A tax is a tax, regardless of why it is levied or how it is spent.
 Good neighbors need to point out the dangers of setting precedents: if the state
 can collect a highway tax it can institute a poll tax, an income tax, a sales
 tax, an excess profits tax, a value-added tax. A hundred and fifty years after
 Thoreau's confrontation with the state gives us adequate proof of the importance
 of taking a consistent and principled stand: <u>ALL</u> taxes are theft. Even Charles
 Lane had noted in his letters on &quot;A Voluntary Political Government&quot;
 (March 27, 1843) that there was no requirement for highway taxes: &quot;the common
 road, like the railroad, [might] be made into a shop keeping business, and paid
 for by every one who used it.&quot; </p>
<p>Thoreau was not a complete voluntaryist. In his essay &quot;On the Duty of
 Civil Disobedience, he distinguished himself from &quot;those who call[ed] themselves
 no-government men&quot;: &quot;I ask for, not <u>at once</u> no government, but at once
 a better government,&quot; conveniently overlooking the fact that improving an
 institution does not change its essential (in this case, coercive) nature. Despite
 this fact Thoreau opened his essay by stating his belief that &quot;That government
 is best which governs not at all.&quot; Voluntaryists can surely agree with him
 on that. </p>
