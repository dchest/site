 <h2>A Short History of Highway and Vehicle Regulations</h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  Number 92 - June 1998</h4>
</center>
<p> The development of the automobile, in contrast to the history of the socialized
 roads upon which it runs, was largely a free market phenomenon. James Flink,
 a professional historian of the automobile, has noted that, &quot;One must conclude
 that the development of adequate automobile roads lagged well behind the diffusion
 of the motor vehicle in the United States and that the automobile was widely
 adopted here despite the relative scarcity of suitable roads for its use. . .
 . American automobiles were improved much more rapidly than the streets and highways
 on which they were driven.&quot; (Flink 211) after the first American gasoline-powered
 automobile was constructed by the Duryea brothers in 1893, car manufacturing
 operations began to spring up all over the country. Carriage makers, like the
 Studebaker Corporation (which claimed to be the world's largest producer of horse-drawn
 vehicles at that time), as well as corner machine shops, had their fling at automobile
 production. Almost any one with mechanical ingenuity and machining facilities
 could get into operation by assembling the parts they had either purchased from
 others or made themselves, and tagging the end result with their own name. &quot;Since
 the first Duryea, there have been a total of more than 2200 different makes of
 automobiles, of which only a handful have survived.&quot; (Shank 52) Flink failed
 to observe that the reason that the average car improved much more rapidly than
 the average road was because of the presence of free market competition and the
 absence of State ownership of the firms that produced automobiles. It was the
 spirit of entrepreneurship and the absence of the State which propelled the development
 of the automobile, and the exact opposite which held back the development of
 American roads.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the political governments of the time had to have their try at
 directly regulating and controlling the automobile. The legal system was used
 as a means of collecting royalties on the use of gasoline engines in automobiles
 by enforcing the Selden patent, but this effort was broken by Henry Ford in 1911.
 Actually, the turn of the century did not mark the beginning of political regulation
 of conveyances. Local and municipal governments were already regulating and licensing
 bicycle usage within their jurisdictions during the 1880s and 1890s. (Mason 42)
 For example, the city of Chicago had a &quot;Wheel Tax&quot; ordinance in effect
 in 1898, which required an annual license fee from all wagons, carriages, coaches,
 buggies, and bicycles. The year 1901 marked the first attempt at levying a registration
 fee specifically on autos (New York State - annual revenue for the year was U$954),
 and at the same time the first law regulating the speed of an automobile was
 passed in Connecticut (12 MPH in the country, 8 MPH in the cities). (Labatut
 95, 99) By 1907, 31 States required registration of motor vehicles, the fees
 varying from 25 cents to U$25 per vehicle. (Dearing 250) The first traffic code
 in the world was adopted by New York City in 1903. (Labatut 454) Many &quot;municipalities
 had their own ordinances regulating speeds, parking, the use of bells, horns
 and gongs, the making of unnecessary exhaust noise and the emission of noxious
 gas, smoke or steam, and they imposed fines for violations. These regulations
 varied widely from city to city and , especially in the smaller municipalities
 were often enforced in a discriminatory way.&quot; (AMER. HWYS. 57, 60) &quot;Speed
 traps&quot; were often operated by local police officers in rural communities
 &quot;with fines going into the local treasury or the pockets of the police,
 justice, or magistrate. The speed trap racket was so bad in New York prior to
 1910, that the Legislature passed an act that year requiring all fines imposed
 for violations of the motor vehicle laws to be turned over to the State treasurer.
 This reduced the fines collected from motorists to a mere trickle.&quot; (AMER.
 HWYS. 60) The effort to standardize traffic codes finally came to fruition in
 1926, when a committee under Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover compiled the first
 national Uniform Vehicle Code. (Tyler 86)</p>
<p>Registration of motor vehicles with local governments often began on a voluntary
 basis; that is government offered a free service as an additional means of identifying
 one's vehicle in the event of theft. &quot;Registration of vehicles was often
 accomplished by a motorist selecting his own numbers and advising a local official
 that such numbers had been affixed to the vehicle - usually on a leather tag.
 The local official filed the record by name and by number. Duplications of numbers
 was avoided by a simple checking procedure . . . [However,] this method of registering
 vehicles was short-lived. . . . [L]ocal authorities secured the passage of ordinances
 . . . [and] some of these early enactments also granted regulatory powers. Thus,
 the basic pattern of motor vehicle administration was established and continued
 its growth to the present time.&quot; (Labatut 442) The New York State law of
 1901 did not require that vehicles be classed in any particular way. All vehicles
 paid the same fee. &quot;The New York law was primarily a measure for legal control
 rather than for revenue, but in later years New York and other States collected
 sizable amounts of money in registration fees.&quot; (AMER. HWYS. 57) Connecticut
 and Massachusetts passed similar legislation in 1903, requiring the registration
 of automobiles and motorcycles on a statewide plan. &quot;Many of these early
 systems were conducted on a basis whereby a flat fee once paid effected registration
 for the life of the vehicle.&quot; (Labatut 443) Registration fees were not the
 only motor vehicle imposts faced by early car owners. &quot;Some cities and villages
 required the motorist to pay a 'wheel tax' of $10 to $20 per year for the privilege
 of driving on their streets. A number of States collected a personal property
 tax on the vehicle in addition to the registration fee.&quot; (AMER. HWYS. 57)</p>
<p>The importance of registration as a means of taxing owners of motor vehicles
 for the &quot;privilege&quot; of being an owner was noted as early as 1903 in
 <em>Horesless Age</em> Magazine : &quot;The Denver [Colorado] automobile ordinance
 has been of much assistance to the assessors of taxes, who have been enabled
 by means of the license requirements to identify and tax the owners [of vehicles].
 Previous to its adoption, it is estimated that one-third of the automobiles in
 the city went untaxed.&quot; (Vol. 11, May 6, 1903, p.564)</p>
<p>&quot;Horace Dodge and Henry Ford lost a 1904 suit that they brought on behalf
 of Detroit's motorists to test the constitutionality of that city's registration
 ordinance. They claimed that the $1 fee constituted double taxation of personal
 property and that the ordinance was unjust 'class Legislation' because owners
 of horse-drawn vehicles were neither forced to carry identification tags nor
 deprived of the right to allow children under sixteen year's of age to drive
 their vehicles.&quot; (Flink 170) In April 1905, the city court of Detroit ignored
 the questions of taxation and held that the ordinance requiring registration
 and display of a license tag on each and every motorized vehicle was &quot;a
 justifiable exercise of police power, in the interest of the safety of the travelling
 public.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon a number of States had enacted registration laws, the question of reciprocity
 arose to plague motorists. In 1907, at least eight States extended no reciprocity
 at all to other States. (Dearing 250) &quot;New York, the leader in the registration
 movement, allowed any vehicle to use its roads, provided the vehicle was registered
 in its own State, and provided that State granted the same privilege to cars
 registered in New York.&quot; (AMER. HWYS. 57) By 1910, fifteen other States
 had reciprocity with New York, but this did not include New Jersey. &quot;As
 a result, thousands of New Yorkers who had summer homes on the Jersey coast had
 to register their machines for the full year in both States. A similar relation
 existed with Massachusetts and 17 other States which did not grant full reciprocity.&quot;
 (AMER. HWYS. 57) As a result of such lack of cooperation between the States,
 groups such as the American Automobile Association (1902) and the National Automobile
 Chamber of Commerce (1913) were organized. Both supported changes in the law
 that would have required Federal, rather than State, registration of all motor
 vehicles, in order to solve the problem of reciprocity among the States. This
 problem was ultimately overcome when all of the States accepted plans for mutual
 reciprocity.</p>
<p><br>
 [Editor's Concluding Note: The above material was discovered while doing research
 on the history of roads and highways. It is undoubtedly sketchy and very incomplete.
 Since private ownership of the roads has never existed, it is difficult to imagine
 what provision property owners and insurance companies would make regarding the
 regulation and use of roads. One historical fact is certain. The population of
 the United States learned to drive cars without any assistance from the State.]</p>
