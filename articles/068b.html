 <h2>Lao-Tzu and Some Advice for the Anarchists</h2>
 <h4>by John A. Van Hulzum<br>
  From Number 68 - June 1994</h4>
</center>
<p> On and off campus there are people who call themselves anarchists. Just for
 fun I bought a book about anarchy, only to see how that subject would be treated.</p>
<p>The book consists of 18 short essays, written by 17 different individuals.</p>
<p>Not a single one looked at anarchy the same way, which should not be surprising
 at all, testifying to an anarchy of thought. Almost all of them were anti-government.</p>
<p>I was very interested because my favorite philosopher can only be looked at
 as an anarchist in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>Anarchy originally only meant &quot;leaderless&quot;, nothing more and nothing
 less. Long before Christ lived, Lao-Tzu said:</p>
<blockquote>
 &quot;If one man leads, another must follow,<br>
 How silly that is, and how false.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>
 Nobody can be born anarchist because every baby depends upon parents or others
 for clothing and shelter.</p>
<p>You can only be an anarchist after you have grown up. Lao-Tzu never said a
 word about being anti-government, but he said a lot about growing up.</p>
<p>Unless one is grown up enough one cannot be without authority and the old sage
 made that quite clear.</p>
<p>He already had what we call a democracy in mind, but he also knew that a democracy
 of ignorant people would not be an ideal form of government.</p>
<p>He therefore did not concentrate very heavily on the technical details of an
 &quot;ideal&quot; government but tried to describe the best way for the components
 of a democracy - individuals - to be worthy of anarchy or self-rule.</p>
<p>This thought of his was expressed as,</p>
<p>&quot;Democracy grows at one's own doorstep.&quot;</p>
<p>I did not find a single one of those 17 so-called learned individuals who referred
 to Lao-Tzu, the one who &quot;wrote the book&quot; on anarchy.</p>
<p><br>
 (Editor's Note: The book referred to is edited by Mike Gunderloy and <a href="051.html">Michael
 Ziesing</a>, <b>Anarchy and the End of History</b>, (1991) and contains an article
 on <a href="../fundamentals/index.html">The Fundamentals of Voluntaryism</a> by Carl Watner.)</p>
