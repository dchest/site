<p> [Editor&#8217;s Note: I first read about <i>Legistlating Morality</i> an offering
  of the Conservative Book Club. After looking at the book I was intrigued by
  the authors&#8217; defense of their thesis, which they summarized as: &#8220;(1)
  Legislating morality is literally unavoidable (morality is always legislated),
  and (2) Americans should legislate the morality common to us all - the one expressed
  in our Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and until recently, the
  laws of our land and decisions of the Supreme Court.&#8221; (p. 8) Read on to
  find out why I believe &#8220;legislating morality&#8221; is neither wise, legal,
  or possible. For those interested in ordering a copy of <i>Legislating Morality</i>

<hr>
<p> May 29, 2001</p>
<p>
  Dear Dr. Geisler and Mr. Turek:</p>
<p> I have read and re-read your book <i>Legislating Morality</i> (1998). In your &#8220;Conclusion&#8221;
  you ask readers to offer a well-reasoned rebuttal if they disagree with you.
  I believe that &#8220;legislating morality&#8221; is neither wise, legal, nor
  possible. The standard by which I answer these questions is that of the natural
  law, which embraces the commandments against murder and theft, and, more generally,
  prohibits all forms of fraud and violence. In short, the natural law standard
  demands that we leave others in peace unless they first trespass against us.
  Voluntaryists advocate coercive government be abandoned since it is at odds
  with this standard because it imprisons peaceful people for violating its political
  laws and for not paying the taxes it levies. Voluntaryists also believe that
  all of the positive things that government does can be provided in a voluntary
  manner on the free market. So in criticizing your arguments, keep in mind that
  I am not just critical of your advocacy of &#8220;legislating morality,&#8221;
  but also questioning your implicit acceptance of the institution of coercive
  government.</p>
<p> In order to keep this &#8220;Open Letter&#8221; reasonably short, and in order
  to keep from duplicating what I have already published on this topic, I ask
  that you at least read over the highlighted sections of the articles in two
  issues of <i>The Voluntaryist</i> (a newletter I have published for the last 19 years),
  which I am enclosing. The articles are: &#8220;Vices Are Not Crimes&#8221; and
  &#8220;Libertarianism and Libertinism&#8221; (from Whole No. 77) and &#8220;Myths
  and Truths About Libertarianism&#8221; (from Whole No. 95). </p>
<p> I would like to make four main points in this &#8220;Open Letter&#8221;. The
  first is that virtue cannot exist at the point of a gun. The second concerns
  the question of when individuals are justified in using physical violence in
  their social relations with others. The third point is: what happens to our
  society when our government is taken over by a crowd of power-seeking, corrupt
  libertines? Finally, the fourth point relates to what Lysander Spooner called
  the absurdity and criminality of lawmaking. </p>
<p>I. Can an action be moral if the actor is threatened with violence or coerced
  to act in a certain manner?</p>
<p> This argument should not be hard to follow. If I am compelled under the threat
  of being jailed not to take drugs, how can my actions be called virtuous? Virtuous
  behavior to be virtuous must be free of the taint of being caused by coercion
  or coercive threats. Virtuous behavior must be freely willed by the individual
  in question. Please read the last half of Myth 3 in &#8220;Myths and Truths
  About Libertarianism,&#8221; which explains that &#8220;compelling moral actions
  or outlawing immoral actions&#8221; cannot foster the spread of virtue. Therefore,
  legislating morality &#8220;robs us of the very opportunity to be moral.&#8221;
  True virtue consists in not doing right, but in freely choosing to do right.</p>
<p>
  II. What is the proper role of violence in society?</p>
<p> In the first section of &#8220;Libertarianism and Libertinism,&#8221; Walter
  Block explains that &#8220;only rights violations should be illegal.&#8221;
  In other words, individuals may only rightfully defend themselves and use or
  threaten violence against others when the boundaries of their person or property
  have been trespassed against. There are many situations where we may consider
  ourselves harmed (eg., witnessing a pervert or prostitute in the act of soliciting),
  but unless our rights of person or property have been violated, we are not justified
  in resorting to violence (e.g., to prevent her from seeking customers). Even
  then, as Block says, violence is justified - not because of the depravity of
  a pervert&#8217;s behavior, but rather - because the pervert has initiated violence.
  Thus when a person who has drunk too much whiskey begins to threaten or violate
  your person or property, you are justified in using violence to compel the drunk
  to stop. What you are justified in stopping is the criminal violence, not the
  drinking. If the drunk were to stay in a drunken stupor in the privacy of his
  home, neither you nor I would be justified in preventing his drinking. In <i>Legislating Morality</i>
  you advocate placing people in jail if they do not behave in ways which
  you deem appropriate - regardless of whether or not they have committed a boundary
  violation or trespass. This violates the natural law standard that unless a
  person has first initiated violence that person should be left in peace. </p>
<p></p>
<p>III. The very existence of government makes it far easier for &#8220;bad&#8221;
  men to exert their influence over society.</p>
<p> One of your constant themes in <i>Legislating Morality</i> is that government laws
  exert a profound influence on the morals of society. As you put it, &#8220;many
  people believe that whatever is legal is moral,&#8221; and the laws &#8220;often
  help change attitudes over the long term.&#8221; [p. 37] You urge that we get
  the right men into political power, so that they can pass the rights laws to
  set society back on track. Consequently, when the wrong types of action are
  legalized by the government, people are more inclined to do them. Wouldn&#8217;t
  it be better to abandon government altogether, and rely on strong voluntary
  social institutions - such as churches, schools, and families - to set high
  standards of morality? Then there would be little chance of having a Bill Clinton&#8217;s
  immoral behavior reach the attention of people all over the world. As it was,
  countless numbers of American children received the impression that his perverted
  sexual behavior was perfectly acceptable. The existence of government was the
  only thing that made such an event possible.</p>
<p>IV. The problem with &#8220;legislating morality&#8221; is that &#8220;common
  sense and reason tell us that nothing can be right by legislative enactment
  if it is not already <a href="http://voluntarycompact.com/the-argument-from-natural-order.html"
    target="_blank">right by nature</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p> In your book, you point out that &#8220;there is a real right and wrong, and
  that real right and wrong is external to ourselves. ... [W]e don&#8217;t determine
  right and wrong, we discover it.&#8221; [p. 114)] &#8220;[T]he morals [we are]
  advocating are not [ours] - [we] didn&#8217;t make them up. [We] didn&#8217;t
  make up the fact that stealing is wrong, that murder is wrong, that abortion
  is wrong, any more than [we] made up the fact that 2+2=4!&#8221; [p. 213] I
  agree with you, but believe that objective natural law/morality actually casts
  doubt on the necessity of government and government legislation. As Epictetus,
  the Stoic, pointed out: if the government directs people to do something that
  reason demonstrates is contrary to the natural moral law (as has happened plenty
  of times in history), the people should defy the government. On the other hand,
  people do not require government, if it merely repeats what their reason would
  have told them to do anyway. </p>
<p> The following comments were written by an American constitutional lawyer in
  1877. In his article &#8220;Against Woman Suffrage,&#8221; Lysander Spooner
  wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> The only law that any human being can rightfully be <i>compelled</i> to obey is simply
  the law of justice. And justice is not a thing that is <i>made</i>, or that can be
  unmade, or altered by any human authority. It is a <i>natural</i> principle, inhering
  in the very nature of man and of things. It is that natural principle which
  determines what is mine and what is thine, what is one man&#8217;s right or
  property and what is another mans right or property. It is, so to speak, the
  line that Nature has drawn between one man&#8217;s right of person and property
  and another man&#8217;s right of person and property.<br>
  This natural principle, which we will call justice, and which assigns to each
  and every human being his or her rights, and separates them from the rights
  of each and every other human being, is, I repeat, not a thing that [is] made,
  but is a matter of science, to be learned like mathematics, or chemistry, or
  geology. And all the laws, so called, that men have ever <i>made</i>, either to create,
  define, or control the rights of individuals, were intrinsically just as absurd
  and ridiculous as would be laws to create, define, or control mathematics, or
  chemistry, or geology.<br>
  Substantially all the tyranny and robbery and crime that governments have ever
  committed - ... - have been committed by them under the pretense of <i>making laws</i>.
  Some man, or body of men, have claimed the right, or usurped the power, of <i>making
  laws</i>, and compelling other men to obey; thus setting up their own will, and
  enforcing it, in place of that natural law, or natural principle, which says
  that no man or body of men can rightfully exercise any arbitrary power whatever
  over the persons or property of other men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Some years later Spooner published <i>A Letter to Grover Cleveland</i>, in which
  he continued to elaborate this theme. He did not believe that natural law needed
  to be enforced by human legislation. Reality enforces the natural laws of justice.
  If human laws</p>
<blockquote>
  command men to do justice, they add nothing to men&#8217;s obligation to do
  it, or to any man&#8217;s right to enforce it. They are therefore mere idle
  wind, such as would be commands to consider the day as day, and the night as
  night. If they command or license any man to do injustice, they are criminal
  on their face. If they command him to do anything which justice does not require
  him to do, they are simple, naked usurpations and tyrannies. If they forbid
  any man to do anything which justice would permit him to do, they are criminal
  invasions of his natural and rightful liberty. In whatever light, therefore,
  they are viewed, they are utterly destitute of everything like authority or
  obligation. ...<br>
  This science of justice, or natural law, is the only science that tells us what
  are, and what are not, each man&#8217;s natural, inherent, inalienable, <i>individual</i>
  rights, as against any and all other men. And to say that any, or all other
  men may rightfully compel him to obey any or all such other laws as they may
  see fit to <i>make</i>, is to say that he has no right of his own , but is their subject,
  their property, and their slave. [<i>A Letter to Grover Clevelan</i> (1886), pp. 3-4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In another essay of 1882, <i>On Natural Law; or the Science of Justice</i>, Spooner
  subtitled his pamphlet &#8220;A Treatise on Natural Law, Natural Justice, Natural
  Rights, Natural Liberty, and Natural Society; Showing That All Legislation Whatsoever
  Is An Absurdity, A Usurpation, and a Crime.&#8221; On page 19 of your book,
  you point out that &#8220;the Founding Fathers believed that rights are God-given
  and, as such, they are universal and absolute - they are the rights of all people
  in all places at all times, regardless of nationality or religion. And since
  everyone is equal, no person has the moral authority to rule over or take away
  the rights of someone else.&#8221; I assume that you concur with their belief
  that all people are equal in their unalienable rights to &#8220;life, liberty,
  and property.&#8221; If this is true, how can you claim the right to establish
  your version of a good society &#8220;where individual dissenters are to be
  suppressed by means of physical force&#8221;? How can &#8220;legislating morality&#8221;
  be &#8220;wise, legal, or possible&#8221; if it necessarily violates the natural
  law standard of not invading against others till they have aggressed against
  you?</p>
<p> In conclusion, Dr. Geisler and Mr. Turek: I hope that both of you co-authors
  take the time to read this letter and the accompanying enclosures. I hope that
  at least one of you will respond. In any case, I plan to publish this &#8220;Open
  Letter&#8221; and any response(s) received from you in <i>The Voluntaryist</i>. </p>
<p> Thank you for writing <i>Legislating Morality</i> and presenting a challenging opportunity
  for a voluntaryist response. <br>

<hr>
<p>June 14, 2001</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Watner:</p>
<p> Thank you for your critique of our book <i>Legislating Morality</i>. In the interest
  of time, I will address briefly each of the four main points of your Open Letter.
  Please forgive my brevity and bluntness.</p>
<p> First, we are not suggesting that most legislation is designed to produce
  virtue in our citizens. Instead, most laws are designed to restrain evil rather
  than compel good (we list a few exceptions to this on page 34). Nevertheless,
  the law is a great teacher that can change attitudes and actions over the long
  term (pages 35-38). Your suggestion that everyone voluntarily do good and fulfill
  their responsibilities takes a very naive view of human nature. As James Madison
  said, &#8220;If men were angels, no government would be necessary.&#8221; Men
  are not angels and therefore good laws are often needed to inform their consciences
  and constrain their behavior so they don&#8217;t destroy the lives, liberty
  or property of others.</p>
<p> Second, your insinuation that &#8220;we advocate placing people in jail [for
  private drinking]&#8221; cannot be found in our text and is false. We don&#8217;t
  advocate any such law. We simply point out that any position on the law (including
  yours, which is that it would be immoral to legislate morality) is itself a
  moral position. It is therefore self-refuting. In other words, the voluntaryist
  wants to legislate morality just as much as the Puritan. You just want different
  moral standards legislated.</p>
<p> Third, I agree there are bad men in government who can abuse their power.
  And I agree there are bad laws. Yet, if there are bad men in government, there
  also bad men in society, which demonstrates the need for good laws and good
  law enforcement. The fact that there is bad government is <i>not</i> an argument for
  <i>no</i> government but an argument for <i>better</i> government. I think you voluntaryist
  approach, while well-intended, would result in anarchy due to the depravity
  of mankind. Our founding father recognized this and built checks and balances
  into our system. While our government is far from perfect, it should be improved,
  not discarded.</p>
<p> Fourth, I wish everyone followed reason but they don&#8217;t. We are not just
  intellectual creatures, but also emotional and volitional. Since men like darkness
  rather than light and have a tendency to suppress the truth rather than follow
  it, they cannot be counted on always to follow the Moral Law. Laws and law enforcement
  are therefore necessary. Moreover, the analogy you make equating mathematics
  to the Moral Law is invalid. If one doesn&#8217;t obey the laws of mathematics,
  he gets his sums wrong. But if one doesn&#8217;t obey the Moral Law, he can
  kill someone. We don&#8217;t need laws punishing people for getting their sums
  wrong, but we do need laws punishing people for harming others. After all, the
  laws of math are self-enforcing. The laws of morality are not.</p>
<p> Finally, good laws do not unduly restrict liberty. (I agree that morality
  can be overlegislated; see pages 211-212) as many laws in the United States
  do. Good laws simply restrict evil in order to prevent evil. We should not have
  to wait until &#8220;they have aggressed against you&#8221; as you suggest.
  Laws are thankfully preventative as well as punitive. </p>
<p> Please give me a call if you would like to discuss this further. I welcome
  the dialog but am a bit short on time to write lengthy letters.</p>
<p> Thanks for your interest!</p>

<p> June 25, 2001</p>
<p>Mr. Frank Turek<br>
  400 Timber Lane<br>
  Matthews, NC 28105</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Turek:</p>
<p> Thank you very much for your June 14th response to my &#8220;Open Letter&#8221;
  about your book <i>Legislating Morality</i>. However it appears that I either totally
  misinterpreted your book, or that you did not understand the four main points
  in my letter.</p>
<p> In Point I (of my letter) I was trying to show that the idea of legislating
  morality is inherently contradictory because virtuous action cannot be produced
  at the point of a gun. Getting people to act morally can be accomplished in
  two ways. First, you can teach people to do the right thing because it &#8220;is&#8221;
  the right thing. Or, you can threaten people with punishments if they do not
  do the right thing. [You use the word &#8220;punish&#8221; in the first line
  of the first paragraph of page 32 of your book.] If people behave morally because
  they fear being caught by a policeman, then - when they realize there are not
  enough policeman to watch everybody - they will revert to immoral behavior.
  People whose behavior is regulated by their internal conscience do not need
  policeman to watch them. </p>
<p> I expect your response to this line of reasoning would be that legislation
  sets the moral tone for a society by defining what types of behavior are acceptable
  and not acceptable (i.e., punishable). But this doesn&#8217;t really address
  my main point, which is that the motivation for acting morally must be considered
  before you can decide if a person is really virtuous. In other words, the man
  who doesn&#8217;t get drunk because he fears punishment is acting differently
  than the man who doesn&#8217;t get drunk because his conscience tells him it
  is unvirtuous to temporarily lose control over his mind and body. (Externally,
  they may both appear to behave similarly.) The man who is motivated by fear
  of punishment is not acting virtuously because true virtue consists not simply
  in doing right, but in <i>freely choosing to do right</i> without the threat of punishment.
  Thus the concept of &#8220;legislating morality&#8221; is contradictory because
  you cannot really legislate &#8220;true&#8221; morality. Legislation only works
  by threatening people with violence if their behavior does not meet the legislative
  standard. In the long run, I do not believe you can build a free and prosperous
  society by producing people who are governed by external threats. </p>
<p> In response to Point II (of my letter) you responded that I insinuate that
  you advocate placing people in jail for their misbehavior [for private drinking.
  It is not clear to me if you were specifically objecting to that conclusion
  (as regards private drinking only), or if you were objecting in general to the
  fact that I accused you of placing people in jail if they did not obey other
  rules of behavior.] But in either case, if you don&#8217;t advocate &#8220;punishing&#8221;
  people with physcial sanctions, then what do you mean by &#8220;legislating&#8221;?
  The act of legislating is the act of passing laws by a governmental body. Such
  laws may possibly be of an advisory nature, meaning people may choose to ignore
  them without legal consequence. Am I wrong in concluding that the types of laws
  you advocate in <i>Legislating Morality</i> are laws which &#8220;punish&#8221; people
  who violate them? National prohibition (from 1920 to 1933) was backed by punishment
  of people who manufactured, transported, and sold intoxicating liquor. They
  were to be placed in jail, have their property confiscated, or both. If people
  don&#8217;t behave in ways that you (or the legislators you choose) deem appropriate,
  then what do you advocate be done to them? Either you have to leave them alone
  or you must use violence on them in order to get them to cease and desist. </p>
<p> Finally, I do not at all understand the flow of logic in the third paragraph
  of your letter where you say that my position is self-refuting. As a voluntaryist
  I do not endorse any sort of coercive government, and certainly do not advocate
  any sort of legislation. However, I do embrace the commands of the natural law
  that there are moral absolutes, such as &#8220;do not murder.&#8221; But these
  types of moral absolutes do not need to be legislated by governments. This is
  because they are either right or wrong by nature and government legislation
  can add nothing to their rightness. Yes, I have a moral position - but I do
  not believe that it must be imposed on others by violence. I do not believe
  in the appropriateness of any sort of legislation. I believe in voluntary social
  institutions setting the moral tone for society. Where government sets the moral
  standards for society, such standards do not induce true morality or virtuousness
  (because they are backed by the threat of the gun). Furthermore, there is the
  very real danger (as we are now experiencing) that corrupt men will take over
  the reins of government and cause the disruption of the rest of society.</p>
<p> I believe the issues you address in <i>Legislating Morality</i> are important ones,
  and look forward to seeing our correspondence published in <i>The Voluntaryist</i>.</p>
<p> Sincerely, <br>
  s/Carl Watner<br>
