[Author's Prologue: This article was written in April
2005, and remained unpublished until this issue. My
reason for hesitation is stated in my opening sentence:
how could an advocate of nonviolence extend the
argument for property rights to include nuclear bombs?
What prompts publication at this time is the appearance
of John Gatto's book, WEAPONS OF MASS
INSTRUCTION: A Schoolteacher's Journey Through
the Dark World of Compulsory Schooling (2009). First,
a bit of humor and an example of serendipity. When I
first read Gatto's book, I took the title to be WEAPONS
OF MASS DESTRUCTION, which is how I view
government, tax-supported, schools. It was only after
discussing the book with friends that I realized my
error.<br/><br/>
Then, as I read the book, I found a section titled
"Building Bombs" (pp. 117-119), which made me think
of this old article and gave me reason to publish it.
Gatto explains that information on "how to produce
powerful explosives cheaply and with ordinary
materials" was widely available a hundred years ago.
Why so?</i><br/>
<p style='margin: 20px;'>
For anyone who understands what the miracle
of America once was (and is no more), that it was
a forge to convert slaves, serfs, peasants and
proletarians into free men and women, explosives
were an important part of self-reliance and
liberty. They were important tools in clearing land,
digging foundations, constructing ponds, building
roads, moving stones, digging gold mines -
perhaps in the gravest extreme defending your
family's liberty from agents of the political state.
Isn't that how we got a United States in the first
place? Has the possibility of a tyranny here miraculously
vanished? But violent conflict aside, and
melodrama with it, the tool aspect alone ought to
be the common right of free citizens. And whether
you agree or not isn't as important as realizing
that less than a hundred years ago, perfectly
ordinary people were trusted to handle power like
this with responsibility. (pp. 118-119)</p><i>
Exactly my sentiments, and while one might argue
that the only purpose of a nuclear bomb is an
aggressive threat, one must keep in mind the similarity
of the concluding word of Gatto's quote and my
article: "responsibility" and "responsibly." Remember,
one can make an aggressive threat with a tree branch.
Should the ownership of trees be outlawed? As a wag
once observed: the reverse side of the coin of freedom
is responsibility. It is not the objects we act with, but
rather how we act with them that determines whether
or not they are invasive and threatening.]</i><br/><br/>
It might seem strange that a voluntaryist who has
published many articles advocating nonviolence would
write a subsequent one arguing for private property rights
in heavy armaments, even nuclear bombs. Odd as this
may appear, let me explain the genesis of this article and
the logic that links the right to gun ownership and voluntaryist
resistance together. First of all: the genesis of this
article. My sons, William and Tucker, have been interested
in hunting and target shooting for a number of years,
and a friend gave us a copy of the December 2004 issue
of the National Riflemen’s Association magazine, AMERICAN
RIFLEMAN. In that issue Wayne LaPierre, NRA
Executive Vice President, had a column in which he mentioned
his debate in London, England on gun control with
Rebecca Peters of IANSA (the International Action Network
on Small Arms). The debate was on video; I obtained
a copy; and, as might be expected, Mr. LaPierre
and Ms. Peters were asked: “Where would you draw the
line in regulating weapons ownership?” If you “allow” small
hand-held sporting weapons, what about semi-automatic
rifles, shotguns, shoulder-fired rockets, and suitcase-size
nuclear weapons? My answer was that ownership rights
to properly homesteaded property extend all across the
weaponry spectrum; from slingshots to nukes.<br/>

“History's most important lesson is that it has not
been possible to make coercion compatible with truth.”
- John Langbein in Alfred McCoy, A QUESTION
OF TORTURE (2006) p. 204</p>
<br/>
I then wondered if any other libertarians had taken
this position, publicly or privately. Robert Heinlein, the
well-known science fiction writer, noted in his 1966 novel,
THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS that it is still
“some” lone individual, whether in his capacity as a
private citizen or government official, that ultimately
controls the disposition of nuclear weapons.<br/>
<p style='margin: 20px;'>
“Too much power in the hands of individuals --
surely you would not want ... well, H-missiles for
example -- to be controlled by one irresponsible
person?”<br/><br/>
“My point is that one person is responsible.
Always. If H-bombs exist -- and they do -- some
man controls them. In terms of morals there is no
such thing as ‘state.’ Just men. Individuals. Each
responsible for his own acts. [Book One, Sec. 6]</p>
Hans-Herman Hoppe in his essay on “The Idea of a
Private Law Society” noted that in a libertarian society
“no restrictions on the private ownership of firearms or
other weapons would exist.” [http://www.mises.org/story/
2265] [paragraph 23] Concomitantly, he observes that
the statist provision of law and order “has led to the
successive disarmament of the population.” All
governments have a natural inclination to disarm their
subjects because, as Hoppe puts it, “it is less dangerous
to collect taxes from an unarmed man than from an armed
man.” In a free society, where protection services are
provided by insurance companies and private defense
agencies, there would be an incentive for private citizens
to be well-trained and certified in the use of weaponry of
all sorts. Hoppe points out, that just as home owners with
alarm systems often receive insurance discounts, so, too,
“those able to certify some level of training in the handling
of arms” would be charged “lower premiums reflecting
the lower risk they represent.”<br/><br/>
The main proponent of private ownership of nuclear
weaponry, however, is the libertarian newspaper writer
Vin Suprynowicz. In his book, THE BALLAD OF CARL
DREGA (Reno, 2002), Mr. Suprynowicz relies on the
United States Constitution, and its Second Amendment,
to defend gun ownership. For example, he argues, “All
federal lawmaking authority is vested in Congress. Is
the Congress authorized to permit or ban or allow or
infringe the private ownership of arms? ... Under our
[constitutional] system, th[e federal] government can
acquire no right, power, or authority except those
delegated to it by the people [via the Constitution].”
[pp. 340-341] He concludes that any Congressional
regulation of the private ownership of firearms is, ipso
facto, unconstitutional. Instead of questioning the
legitimacy of the Constitution, Mr. Suprynowicz blithely
asserts that, “The founders were careful to note that they
found mankind’s natural rights to be pre-existing” and
“insisted that the ‘securing’ of those pre-existing rights
[wa]s the only legitimate purpose of government.” [p.468]<br/>
<p style='float:right; width:300px; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding:5px;'>
“So long as there is government, there shall be no
peace and no justice.”
- John Simpson</p>
<br/>
In summary, Mr. Suprynowicz argues that since the
federal government possesses nuclear warheads, it must
have derived that right from somewhere. That “somewhere”
he finds is in the individual American’s right to
own them. In other words, since individual Americans
have the “right, power, and authority to own nuclear
weapons,” they may delegate that right to their protector,
the American government. [p. 341] In response to a
reader’s question: “Do ‘I advocate the unrestricted
right to own weapons of mass destruction’?” he replies,
“No, I <i>acknowledge</i> this pre-existing right of all
individuals to own such weapons.” [pp. 419-420,
emphasis in the original]<br/><br/>
As I pointed out in my article about the Bill of Rights,
“The Illusion Is Liberty - the Reality is Leviathan,”
[I MUST SPEAK OUT (San Francisco, 1999)] the first
ten amendments to the Constitution were essentially a
legitimizing device used by those favoring a strong central
government. James Madison believed that the amendments
were needed to forestall Anti-Federalist criticism
of the Constitution. Under the English common law
“basic, natural, and fundamental individual rights were
protected whether enumerated specifically in the
Constitution or not,” so there was really no reason to have
a Constitution or Bill of Rights. Depending upon the
Second Amendment to defend individual ownership of
weapons has only led to insuperable difficulties (as
evidenced by the question: where do you draw the line?).
The Second Amendment is at most superfluous to the
case for gun ownership for two reasons. First, it implies
that gun ownership rights may be be subject to change if
enough votes are garnered to amend the Constitution.
Second, it ignores the point that weaponry ownership is
not a special case, but rather depends upon the
justification of property ownership in general.<br/><br/>
As a voluntaryist, my starting points are the
libertarian self-ownership and homesteading axioms.
Each person has the absolute right, by virtue of being
a human being, to own his or her own mind and body;
that is to control that body and mind free of coercive
interference. Similarly, each person, by virtue of his or
her owning his or her own labor, owns previously unused
natural resources which he or she is the first to claim and
transform by that labor. Nuclear weapons are the end
product of the application of human labor to natural
resources. If they were conceived, invented, and built on
the free market (a big assumption, indeed - the
development of such weapons was strictly the outgrowth
of government wars) then there can be no objection to
the ownership and sale of such property. From a straight
property rights/property title view point, so long as the
property has been homesteaded or voluntarily transferred,
there is every reason to argue for unrestricted ownership
of weapons, of whatever type. The caveat is that the owner
is always liable for their responsible use, just as the owner
of a car or a knife is responsible for its safe use and
handling. One well might ask: Can nuclear weapons be
used responsibly and in a strictly defensive manner? But
that question is irrelevant to the considerations of
proprietary justice and ownership. (One might well own
something, without ever using it.)<br/><br/>
At one point, Vin Suprynowicz refers to a “God-given
constitutionally guaranteed right to self defense.” [p.376]
Voluntaryists would recognize a natural right to self-defense,
which includes using their bodies and properties
in a defensive manner, albeit, violently or non-violently.
If the right to self-defense is “constitutionally
guaranteed” does not this imply that such a right might
be changed by constitutional amendment? Individuals
have the right to use their bodies and property to resist
what we collectively view as evil or wrongdoing. As the
voluntaryist insight points out, no ruler exists without the
cooperation and/or acquiescence of the majority of his
subjects. The revolutionary implications which stem from
this simple observation are earth-shattering. Non-violent
resistance, which flows directly from the self-ownership
and homesteading axioms, is the political equivalent of
the atomic bomb. From sling shots to nukes to nonviolent
resistance, these choices all flow from the individual’s right
to use his or her body and property responsibly.</p>
