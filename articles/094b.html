 <h2>A Fund Raising Appeal for <i>The Voluntaryist</i> Anthology</h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  Number 94 - Oct 1998</h4>
</center>
<p> For almost a year now, I have had the idea of publishing an anthology containing
 the best articles from the first 100 issues of <i>The Voluntaryist</i>. I have mentioned
 it to a number of friends and long-time subscribers, and each one has thought
 it a worthwhile idea. Tentatively the anthology will consist of articles categorized
 into the following topics: Statement of Purpose; Voting, Strategy, and Non-violent;
 Personal; Voluntaryist Solutions to social and Economic Problems of the Past;
 Robert LeFevre - Freedom School; Money and Economics; Voluntaryist Critiques
 of Government; Book Reviews: Schooling and Children; Anarcho-Capitalism; Miscellaneous;
 a complete Table of Contents for the first 100 issues; and possibly a Topical
 Index.</p>
<p>The beauty of the anthology is that the most important and significant articles
 appearing in <i>The Voluntaryist</i> over the last sixteen years would be bound together
 in one volume. This collection would be unique in may ways. First of all, there
 is no other body of literature that embraces the methods and strategy of <i>The Voluntaryist</i>. Voluntaryists are the only ones who reject electoral politics and
 voting - on the grounds that such activities support the legitimacy of the State.
 Whether you embrace nonviolent strategies on moral or practical grounds, the
 ideas of Thoreau, Gandhi, And Robert LeFevre certainly offer an alternative to
 &quot;politics as usual.&quot; The historical articles that have appeared in
 <i>The Voluntaryist</i> deal mostly with examples of how people have lived without the
 State at various times in history. Many of the critiques of the American government
 can be found nowhere else, because few libertarians have analysed the legitimacy
 of American government. Another reason that the anthology will be unique is that
 over time, as editor of <i>The Voluntaryist</i>, I have tried to choose and publish
 classic essays in voluntaryist thought. Many of these, such as John Pugsley's
 &quot;The Case Against T-Bills and Other Thoughts on Theft,&quot; Harry Browne's
 &quot;A Visit to Rhinegold,&quot; and Randy Barnett's &quot;Pursuing Justice
 in a Free Society,&quot; will be preserved in this anthology. In book form those
 ideas will be more usable and accessible to individuals than in the single issue
 format in which they originally appeared. In short, I believe the anthology is
 a valuable expenditure of time and money.</p>
<p>Readers may be familiar with similar publishing projects that I have engaged
 in over the years. Both A Voluntary Political Government: Letters from Charles
 Lane, and Truth is not a Half-Way Place: A biography of Robert LeFevre were self-published
 with assistance of friends and subscribers. My hope is to repeat these efforts
 by raising enough money to typeset and print <i>The Voluntaryist</i> anthology. Unfortunately,
 most of the articles have not been saved on disk, so they must be scanned or
 re- typed. Perhaps, a small commercial publishing house might be found to print
 and market the book. Failing that, my intention would be to self-publish the
 book, market it to libraries, individual subscribers, and libertarian booksellers.
 From this vantage point, it is impossible to know the total amount needed, but
 from past experience I estimate costs for both typesetting and printing to be
 in the range of US $3000 to US $5000, depending on the number of copies actually
 printed.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please support it by sending a donation.
 Those who contribute U$50 or more will receive an autographed copy of the finished
 book, at no further cost to them. If any funds are left over they will be used,
 pro rata, to extend the subscriptions of those making donations. Those wanting
 to see the titles of articles chosen for the anthology, may obtain the complete
 list by sending US $2 cash and a No. 10 self-addressed envelope. Input from readers
 and subscribers is certainly welcome. </p>
