 <h2>Drawing The Line</h2>
 <h4>by Blair Adams<br>
  From Number 59 - December 1992<br>
  (from <i>Who Owns the Children?</i> (1991) p. 292)</h4>
</center>
<p>It certainly appears, on the surface and in the short run, easier to come to
 some sort of compromise with the State and allow it to have some say in the education
 of our children. Yet such a compromise can only feebly palliate our position
 for that day when the State comes and insists that we must teach what we conscientiously
 oppose. Minimum Requirements do indeed <em>appear</em> reasonable. And probably
 few Christian parents or schools fail to teach their children the basic subjects
 that the proponents of this view include in their list of prescribed courses.
 ... This is quite different, however, from acknowledging that the State has the
 right to <em>compel</em> us to teach our children these things, particularly
 when the State has so miserably failed in teaching &quot;its&quot; own children
 these very requirements.</p>
<p>Moreover, once we grant this principle, where can we possibly draw the line?
 If we agree that the State has the legitimate authority to mandate the teaching
 of that which society generally agrees as essential to social communication and
 good citizenship because we may agree with those basic requirements today, what
 if tomorrow the consensus of an increasingly corrupt society (as in Nazi Germany)
 goes beyond our prior agreement? If tomorrow we say that we cannot agree to the
 State's requirements, then we can only in good conscience refuse to submit to
 those requirements if we deny that the State ever had that rightful authority
 in the first place. If the State has <em>legitimate</em> power to control education,
 then obviously that control cannot be defined by those over whom it is to be
 exercised. Either the State has the legitimate power or it does not. If we accept
 any governmental authority in this area today, we greatly weaken and compromise
 our position for the battles that will inevitably come tomorrow. Unless we confess
 now that absolute, given limits prevent us from submitting in good conscience
 to any governmental control of education, we shall have compromised our position
 for the future.</p>
