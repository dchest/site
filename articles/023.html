 <h2>&quot;Hard Money&quot; in the Voluntaryist Tradition</h2>
 <h4>by Carl Watner<br>
  From Issue 23 - Jan. 1987</h4>
</center>
<p>At least twice in his career, Lysander Spooner (1801 - 1887) commented on the
existence and circulation of privately made gold coins in the United States. In
1844, when rebutting the Postmaster General's claim that the constitutional right
of Congress to establish post office post roads was an exclusive one, like that
of coining money, Spooner noted that</p>
<blockquote>
 Provided individuals do not 'counterfeit' or 'imitate' 'the securities or current
 coin of the United States,' they have a perfect right, and Congress have no power
 to prohibit them, to weigh and assay pieces of gold and silver, mark upon them
 their weight and fineness, and sell them for whatever they will bring in competition
 with the coin of the United States. It was stated in Congress a few years ago,
 . . . , that in some parts of the gold reigon of [North Carolina], a considerable
 portion of their local currency consisted of pieces of gold, weighed, assayed,
 and marked by an individual, in whom the public had confidence. And this practice
 was as unquestionably legal, as the sale of gold in any other way.<br>
 </blockquote>
 In 1886, in <em>A Letter to Grover Cleveland</em>, Spooner observed that the
power of Congress to coin money was simply a power to weigh and assay metals and
that there was no necessity that such a service be provided by or be limited to
the federal government. Spooner claimed it would have been best if all coins made
by the authority of Congress or private individuals &quot;had all been made into
pieces bearing simpy the names of pounds, ounces, pennyweights, etc., and containing
just the amounts of pure metal described by those weights. The coins would then
have been regarded as only so much metal; . . . And all the jugglery, cheating,
and robbery that governments have practiced, and licensed individuals to practice
- by coining pieces bearing the same names, but having different amounts of metal
- would have been avoided.&quot; Spooner also mentioned that for many years after
the discovery of gold in California, &quot;a large part of the gold that was taken
out of the earth, was coined by private persons and companies, and this coinage
was perfectly legal. And I do not remember to have ever heard any complaint or
accusation, that it was not honest and reliable.&quot; </p>
<p>Spooner's references to private gold coinage reflect the poineers' search for
 a way to satisfy their monetary needs. Where there were no government mints and
 when State coinage was scarce, but where gold was plentiful, it was only natural
 that the demand for gold coinage would be satisfied by market means. This aspect
 of numismatic history of the United States demonstrates how &quot;natural society&quot;
 operates in the absence of the State. If there is a market demand for a good
 or service, then some entrepreneur(s) will satisfy it. The people of the frontier
 were more concerned with the intrinsic worth and quality of their media of exchange
 than with who issued it. There was nothing special about coinage. In the Southeast
 during the Civil War it became customary to specify the settlement of monetary
 obligations in &quot;Becthler gold&quot; rather than Union coin or Confederate
 or state currencies. A similar preference manifested itself in Colorado, where
 Clark, Gruber &amp; Co. coins were the preffered media of exchange during the
 same era. </p>
<p>The production and circulation of these coins was absolutely legal, though
 never sanctioned by any positive law. &quot;By the time of the Colorado gold
 rush, [the] private coiners' common law right to issue gold coins of intrinsic
 value comparable to the Federal products was undisputed.&quot; A &quot;common
 law right&quot; simply means the right to engage in any form of peaceful, honest
 market activities. No activity, commercial or otherwise, is outlawed, unless
 it is inherently invasive of another person and/or his or her property. </p>
<p>The &quot;hard money&quot; movement today has little if no understanding of
 the significance of the voluntary principle and the voluntaryist approach to
 social change. First, few &quot;hard money&quot; advocates believe in a monetary
 system totally free of State interference. Secondly, only a few seem prepared
 to abandon legal tender laws and adopt the principle of the specific performance
 doctrine (that monetary debts can be settled only in accord with the specifications
 of the contract of debt). Thirdly, many seem enamored of lobbying for legislative
 changes rather than ignoring unjust laws and seeking to make those laws unenforceable
 through mass noncompliance. Even the legalization of gold ownership and the legalization
 of gold clauses in private contracts is clouded because of the past confiscatory
 history of the United States government during the New Deal and the continued
 existence of legal tender laws today. It should be fairly obvious that a State
 strong enough to legislate and enforce legal tender laws is certainly strong
 enough to abrogate such laws when it so chooses. The voluntaryist attitude that
 positive legislation and court decisions can never overrule the natural rights
 of individuals to deal in gold or silver is negated by most hard money advocates
 when they use the legislative process to obtain permission to own gold and use
 the gold clause in contracts. </p>
<p>Just over 100 years ago, private issues of gold coins and ingots were the dominant
 media of exchange in the western areas of this country. Gold issues today, such
 as the Englehard gold &quot;Prospector,&quot; and the output of Gold Standard
 Corp. in Kansas City, are reminiscent of this earlier frontier era. Even the
 United States government is trying to take advantage of investor interest in
 gold coins, by issuing the new gold &quot;Eagle,&quot; a one ounce coin with
 a legal tender value of $50. Before 1933, when FDR's administration confiscated
 all privately held gold (with the exception of numismatic coins), an ounce of
 gold was worth $20 on the market. Since that time no political administration
 has ever returned the confiscated gold to its rightful owners. Meanwhile the
 one ounce gold coin which was then referred to as a &quot;double eagle&quot;
 has become dubbed the &quot;Eagle&quot; (which formerly was only one-half ounce
 of gold) and the new coin's legal tender value bears no relationship to the free
 market price of gold (which at the time of this writing is about $400 per ounce).
 Unlike today, the almost complete absence of paper currency, coupled with the
 traditional use of gold coins, led to the rejection of federal greenbacks in
 California during the time of the Civil War. </p>
<p>Private gold coinage had its origins during the gold rush that occurred in
 Georgia and North Carolina in 1828. Prior to the discovery of gold in California
 in 1848, these southeastern states produced more gold than any other region in
 the country. In 1840, the Director of the Mint, in his report to Congress, referred
 to Christopher Bechtler who operated a private mint in Rutherfordton, North Carolina,
 in competition with the U.S. mint at Charlotte. The Mint Director could take
 no legal action against Bechtler, for he observed: &quot;It seems strange that
 the privilege of coinage should be carefully confined by law to the General Government,
 while that of coining gold and silver, though withheld from the States, is freely
 permitted to individuals, with the single restriction that they must not imitate
 the coinage established by law.&quot; </p>
<p>By the time of the California Gold Rush, Bechtler and his family had minted
 well in excess of 100,000 coins. Though the mint in Charlotte had been established
 in 1838, the Bechtlers continued to issue gold coins until the late 1840's. Their
 mint successfully competed with the mint at Charlotte because the Bechtlers were
 much closer to the gold mining areas and had an established reputation. </p>
<p>In California, many of the conditions which had originally sparked the Bechtler
 mint into life were to be found. American settlement began in California as early
 as 1841, and by 1846 there was extreme agitation for making California an American
 territory. U.S. forces occupied California during the Mexican War, and in 1848
 Mexico ceded all of its claims to California to the United States. Gold was discovered
 in January 1848 and the Gold Rush, as we know it, began in the fall of that year.
 Military government lasted until October 1849, at which time a state convention
 created a constitution and made a formal request for admission to the Union.
 Meanwhile government on all levels barely existed: There was no formal law, there
 were no jails, immigration to the gold fields progressed unimpeded, and the military
 strength of the Federal government was relatively weak. Finally, in September
 1850, California was accepted as a state and the struggle began to establish
 formal government. Communication with the East was difficult until the telegraph
 reached the state in 1861, and transportation remained a problem even after direct
 rail connection was made with the East in 1869. </p>
<p>The requirements of the early mercantile community in California, especially
 of San Francisco businesses, led directly to many of the events in which we are
 interested. According to Federal law in effect in 1849, all custom duties due
 the United States were payable in lawful United States coin. Accordingly, every
 piece of coined money which existed in California was hoarded to pay import duties
 and the normal channels of trade suffered from a shortage of coined money. At
 first gold dust was used as a substitute for coined money, but the military governor
 discovered that the law regarding duties could only be satisfied by a tender
 of coins, whether gold or silver. Thus gold coins eventually came to command
 a premium over gold dust since they were desperately needed at the Custom House.
 Since the supply of coins was so limited, it was suggested by members of the
 mercantile community that private assayers issue gold pieces to fill the need.
 The first suggestion to this effect appeared in July 1848, and by early 1849
 private issues were struck. The private issues enabled the miners to get more
 coined money for their gold dust and allowed a greater number of coins to circulate
 in general trade. </p>
<p>The first private gold coin was probably issued by the firm of Norris, Gregg
 &amp; Norris and was followed, during the summer of 1849, by strikes from the
 assay and gold brokerage business of Moffat &amp; Co. At first gold dust was
 assayed and formed into rectangular ingots with the firm's name, the fineness
 (in carats) and the dollar value appearing on the bar. Shortly thereafter a $10
 gold piece, struck as a circular coin, was issued by Moffat &amp; Co. By the
 end of 1849, a virtual avalanche of private issues had found circulation in California,
 including minting work done by the Mormons in Salt Lake City, by J. S. Ormsby
 &amp; Co., and the Miners' Bank. </p>
<p>The coins with which the early Californians had to do business soon fell into
 disrepute, as it was discovered that their intrinsic value did not always match
 their stamped value. The Mormon coins, which only contained $17 worth of gold
 in a $20 piece, soon ceased to circulate, as did many of the other private coins.
 The holders of such pieces had to sell their coins at bullion value and pocket
 the loss. Moffat &amp; Co., whose pieces were always worth at least 98 percent
 of their stamped value, continued to issue coins in 1850, at which time there
 also appeared new issues by Baldwin &amp; Co., Dubosqu &amp; Co., and by Frederick
 Kohler, the newly appointed state assayer. </p>
<p>By April 1850 the coin situation had come to the attention of the state legislature
 and during the same month laws were passed which prohibited private mints. Simultaneously,
 to fill the demand for coined money, the California legislature created the State
 Assay Office, which was responsible for assaying gold dust, forming it into bars,
 and stamping it value and fineness thereon. The State Assay Office is unique
 because it was the only establishment of its kind ever operated in the United
 States under the authority of a state government, and because its issues were
 so closely allied to that of gold coinage it is questionable that it did not
 violate the constitutional clause against state coinage. The State Assay Office
 was soon superseded by The U.S. Assay Office, which was established by Federal
 statute on September 30, 1850. Moffat &amp; Co. became the contractor for the
 U.S. Assay Office and began operations in this capacity in February 1851. A month
 later the state prohibition on private coinage was repealed, since well over
 a million dollars' worth of gold had been privately coined in the first quarter
 of 1851 alone, so great was the demand for bars and coins. </p>
<p>Although Moffat &amp; Co. became associated with the U.S. government as its
 assay contractor, they always recognized the right of private persons or firms
 to issue their own gold coins. In responding to criticisms leveled directly at
 them during the passage of the state prohibition on private issues they stated
 : &quot;We aver that we have violated no law of the United States in regard to
 coining (our own) money; that we have defrauded no man of one cent by issuing
 our coin; that we have in no instance refused or failed to redeem in current
 money of the United States all such issues without detention or delay, and we
 hold ourselves ready now and at all times hereafter to do so. . . . We hold ourselves
 responsible for the accuracy of our stamp, whether it be upon bullion or in the
 forms of ingots or coin. If there be error then the party aggrieved has his remedy
 at common law.&quot; </p>
<p>Moffat &amp; Co. was apparently the most responsible of the private concerns
 minting money, for in April 1851, the businesses of San Francisco placed an embargo
 on all private gold coinage except Moffat. The remainder of the private issues
 were soon sent to the U.S. Assay Office, slugs of not less than $50 were to be
 issued. Such ingots were too large for normal trade and soon a demand grew for
 coins of smaller denominations. Moffat &amp; Co., as contractors for the U.S.
 Assay Office, requested authority to issue such coins. Since their authority
 was not forthcoming, in the end Moffat &amp; Co bowed to the demands of the merchants
 and minted such soins under their own authority and mark. </p>
<p>The situation worsened in 1852, when the U.S. Customs House refused to accept
 the $50 ingots issued by the U.S. Assay Office. Although these slugs were issued
 under the direct authority of the Federal government, their fineness was only
 that of the average California gold, perhaps 887/1000 fine. A new federal law
 required that all customs duties be paid in gold coinage of the fineness of standard
 U.S. coins, which was 900/1000 fine. Therefore the Treasury Department instructed
 its agents not to accept the issues of its own Assay Office, until these issues
 met the required fineness. The Washington authorities did not seem to recognize
 the ridiculousness of their decision, which not only disparaged their own issues,
 but practically denied the merchants any circulating medium at all. Eventually
 the controversy was settled by having the Assay Office conform to the higher
 fineness. </p>
<p>The Federal mint, which had long been agitated for in California, went into
 partial operation in April 1854. Within a few years it satisfied all the demand
 for coins. Until it went into full-scale operation, however, the demand for circulating
 coins was met by the issues of such private concerns as Kellogg &amp; Richter,
 Kellogg &amp; Humbert, and Wass. Molitor &amp; Co. At the end of 1855 it was
 estimated that there was still some five to eight million dollars' worth of private
 coin in circulation. In the summer of 1856 coin was needed in San Francisco for
 export purposes, and both the issues of the U.S. mint and private coins were
 used to meet this need. By October 1856 the Federal mint was apparently able
 to meet all demands for coins in domestic circulation and for export, so that
 private issues of gold coin quietly passed out of existence. There is no record
 of any further private minting in California after this time. </p>
<p>Although paper money found circulaton in the East, at no time before the Civil
 War did banknotes play a substantial part in the circulating media of California.
 Between the cessation of private issues and the outbreak of the Civil War, the
 Federal mint in San Francisco continued to satisfy all demands for coins. This
 tradition of handling gold and silver coinage in California was buttressed by
 the provision of the state constitution which expressly prohibited the creation
 of any (paper) credit instruments designed to circulate as money. </p>
<p>The metallic coinage of the Californians had provided them with a remarkable
 prosperity and stable purchasing power. Therefore, when as a result of the Civil
 War the Federal government issued legal tender notes in 1862, Californians were
 faced with the prospect of handling paper money for the first time. Acceptance
 and use of these new &quot;greenbacks&quot; (which had no gold backing, only
 the general credit of the government behind them) became a subject of public
 debate in California. Objections to the new currency concerned its constitutionality
 and the likelihood of its depreciation in terms of purchasing power. </p>
<p>Creditors were particularly fearful that their interests would be hurt as it
 would be possible for debtors to repay their loans in depreciated currency. At
 first this is exactly what happened, as can be seen from the grievance of a Sacramento
 financier : </p>
<blockquote>
 About four years ago [1859] I loaned $10,000 in gold coin of the United States
 to John Smith of Sacramento City, for which said Smith executed me a note, in
 the usual form, bearing interest at the rate of one and one-half per cent per
 month. This note I placed in the hands of my bankers, D. O. Mills &amp; Co.,
 Sacramento, with the instructions to receive and receipt for the interest as
 it accrued thereon, and also to collect the principal at maturity. In January
 last [1865], Mr. Smith called at the banking house . . . and tendered $10,000
 in greenbacks in payment in full on the note executed to me, knowing that the
 said notes were not at that time worth more than 68&cent; on the dollar. . .
 . [My bankers] refused to receive the tendered greenbacks without consultation
 with me, and, moreover denounced the conduct of Mr. Smith as unfair in the extreme,
 at the same time reminding him of the fact that he had received the whole amount
 in gold coin. After a conference more protracted than pleasant, Mr. Smith offered
 to pay $10,000 in greenbacks and $1,000 in gold, which proposition, rather than
 be a party to a tedious and expensive lawsuit, I assented to. . . . As it is,
 I am loser to the amount of $2,200, allowing 68&cent; on the dollar for greenbacks,
 and at the rate they are now selling - and I still have them on hand - my loss
 is about $3,500.</blockquote>
<p>
 However, there were those who favored introduction of the legal tender notes
 in California. Loyalty and patriotism to the Union were advanced as the chief
 reasons. Some thought that a refusal by the people of California to use the currency
 of the Federal government would be tantamount to secession. Others felt that
 the greenbacks would act as a stimulus to business, and hoped to profit from
 the speculation inherent in their use. </p>
<p>Since the Federal notes continued to lose purchasing power, the commercial
 elements in San Francisco realized that a definite stand had to be taken on the
 use and acceptance of the greenbacks in local transactions. Business that had
 contracts with the Federal government were hard hit by the inflation, as they
 had expected to receive gold coin for their work and instead were paid in paper
 of a lesser value. Federal employees also found themselves at a serious disadvantage
 in receiving their wages and salaries in depreciated money, while their expenses
 were counted in gold. In November 1862 the merchants of San Francisco attempted
 to counter the use of greenbacks by effecting an agreement among themselves </p>
<blockquote>not to receive or pay out legal tender at any but market value, gold being
 adhered to as the standard. The plan was to have this agreement signed by all
 the leading firms of the city; then to have it signed also by all other firms,
 both those in the city, and those in the country who had dealings with the city.
 If any one refused to enter the association, or having agreed to pay for goods
 in gold, paid for them in greenbacks at par instead, then his name should be
 entered in a black book, and the firms all over the State should be notified
 so that in all his subsequent dealings he would be obliged to pay for his goods
 in gold at the time of purchase.</blockquote>
<p>
 As early as July 1862 questions raised by the circulation of the greenbacks had
 received attention in the courts. A case was brought before the Supreme Court
 of California during this month which sought &quot;To compel the defendant, as
 tax collector of the city and county of San Francisco, to accept from the relator
 $270.45 in United States notes tendered in payment for the present year.&quot;
 The tax collector had refused to accept the tender of paper money, claiming that
 his duty was to accept only &quot;legal coin of the United States, or foreign
 coin at the value fixed for such coin by the laws of the United States.&quot;
 The court judged in favor of the tax collector and thus prohibited the payment
 of taxes in greenbacks. </p>
<p>At the same time the State Treasurer pulled off an ingenious financial coup
 by taking advantage of depreciation of the paper currency. The plan was to collect
 the Federal direct tax in coin and pay it into the U.S. Treasury in legal tender
 notes, saving the difference for the state. This &quot;earned&quot; the state
 the sum of $24,620, but the action was almost universally condemned. The moral
 attitude of the San Franciscans on paying their debts in depreciated money is
 well illustrated by the fact that the interest on the City's municipal bonds
 were paid in gold at New York, rather than in legal tender notes. To pay in depreciated
 notes was considered beneath the dignity of the city and a real violation of
 the faith pledged with the holders of the bonds abroad. </p>
<p>Although Californians could continue to own gold the very existence of the
 legal tender law created a general feeling of insecurity. The merchants of San
 Francisco were determined to remain on the gold standard and they were encouraged
 by the decision of the court in favor of the tax collector. In order to keep
 the business of the state on a gold basis, however, it became clear to the merchants
 that legislation must be had to enable the parties to a contract to enforce the
 collection of the kind of money which had been specified in the contract. They
 had at first attempted to agitate for exemption of California from the Federal
 legal tender law, but their resolution to this effect in the state legislature
 was postponed indefinitely. Later, resolutions were introduced in the legislature
 to obtain relief for those working for the Federal government by having them
 paid in gold coin. Nothing was gained by the discussion of these resolutions
 except to arouse the ire of advocates of the greenbacks. </p>
<p>These legislative maneuvers, even if they had been successful, would not have
 accomplished what was needed to keep the state on a specie basis. Slowly people
 realized that, where there were two different types of money in circulation,
 legislation was needed to make it possible to enforce contracts in either paper
 currency or metallic coinage, as provided for in the contract. Advocates of such
 legislation held that &quot;contracts fairly made in view of all the circumstances
 ought to be enforced. If, then, contracts are made specifically to be performed
 by the payment of gold, it seems to us to be a duty on the part of the legislature
 to provide the remedy for their enforcement. Common honesty cannot refuse this.&quot;
</p>
<p>The legislation which accomplished this objective was approved on April 27,
 1863. By amending the procedures in civil cases, writs of execution or judgment
 on a contract or obligation for the direct payment of money in a specified kind
 of money or currency had to be fulfilled by the same kind of money or currency
 that was specified in the original contract or obligation. This came to be known
 as the Specific Performance Act or Specific Contract Law, since it voided the
 requirement of the Federal legal tender act and substituted the provisions of
 each contract for purposes of determining what kind of money was to satisfy a
 debt. In the discussion that led to the passage of this bill in the state legislature
 it was pointed out that there was no mention of gold or silver in the law itself.
 The law simply let the freely contracting parties choose the means of payment
 between themselves. Formerly there had been no legal means to enforce payment
 of gold coin on a contract or debt, even though it had been specified as the
 means of payment. A man owing $100 in gold could pay it with $100 of legal tender
 notes, even if $100 in notes would only buy $50 in gold coin. Now a creditor
 could seek justice. Supporters of this legislation were not entirely antagonistic
 to the use of legal tender notes, but they saw no reason to compel acceptance
 of paper money at an artifically enforced value. The law did not discriminate
 between the two types of money, but it enabled the parties to make contracts
 understandingly and upon equal terms, regardless of whether they choose gold
 or paper as the means of payment. </p>
<p>Any opposition to the Specific Contract Law which may have existed was disarmed
 by a State Court decision of July 1864, which upheld the act as constitutional.
 It was ruled that the specific contract to pay in gold was more than a contract
 merely for the payment of money, but went to the extent of defining by what specific
 act the contract should be performed. The court noted that, </p>
<blockquote>A contract payable in money generally is undoubtedly, payable in any kind of
 money made by law legal tender at the option of the debtor at the time of payment.
 He contracts simply to pay so much money, and creates a debt pure and simple;
 and by paying what the law says is money his contract is performed. But, if he
 agrees to pay in gold coin, it is not an agreement to pay money simply, but to
 pay or deliver a specific kind of money, and nothing else; and the payment in
 any other is not a fulfillment of the contract according to its terms or the
 intention of the parties. (25 Cal. 564)</blockquote>
<p>
 The Specific Performance Act was also held to apply to contracts made before
 its passage. In an action brought before the court to enforce gold payment of
 a note which had been executed before the passage of this legislation, it was
 held that &quot;where laws confessedly retrospective have been declared void,
 it has been upon the ground that such laws were in conflict with some vested
 right, secured either by some constitutional guarantee or protected by the principles
 of universal justice.&quot; But this act &quot;takes a contract as it finds it,
 and simply enforces a performance of it according to its terms,&quot; and is
 not changing the relations of the parties to the contract. The Specific Contract
 Law was also used to enforce payment under agreements &quot;to pay a specific
 sum in gold coin or upon failure thereof, to pay such further sum as might be
 equal to the difference in value between gold coin and legal tender notes.&quot;
 As the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce noted in 1864, the Specific Contract
 Act &quot;simply enforces the faithful performance of contracts. It enjoins good
 faith, a principle which lies at the very foundation of public prosperity, and
 without which there can be no mutual confidence, no progress, no credit and no
 trade.&quot; </p>
<p>Apparently the Federal government took little or no notice of the actions of
 the Californians during the Civil War. In fact the Specific Contract Law remains
 on the California statute books (as Section 667 of the California Code of Civil
 Procedures) and has never been changed by California legislation. And it was
 not until 1935 that the Federal government took any action to abrogate this state
 legislation (by outlawing gold clause contracts). However, as early as 1861 the
 Secretary of the Treasury realized that private coinage was a danger to the government's
 own prerogatives. Between 1860 and and 1862 the firm of Clark, Gruber &amp; Co.
 was engaged in the manufacture of their own coins from their mint in the city
 of Denver. Here again, the demand for a circulating medium was satisfied by private
 means before the government was able to act. The Clark, Gruber coins were of
 high quality and always either met or exceeded the gold bullion value of similar
 United States coins. In a peroid of less than two years this firm minted approximately
 three million dollars' worth of coin. Their mint promised to outdo the government's
 own production, and to get rid of them, the government bought them out in 1865
 for $25,000. </p>
<p>Such private competition with the Federal mints led to an amendment of the
 coinage laws of the United States which prohibited private coinage. By an Act
 of Congress, on June 8, 1864, it was ruled : </p>
<blockquote>That if any person or persons, except now authorized by law, shall hereafter

<p>
 It was not until after 1870, when Federal bank charters were granted to banks
 in California, that banknote circulation gained any real foothold in California.
 The entire history of California money up until that time supports the observation
 that &quot;the more efficient money will drive from circulation the less efficient
 if the individuals who handle money are left free to act in their own interest.&quot;
 Thus in the early period the Moffat coinage, because it was consistently of higher
 quality, won out in the struggle among private issues. Since there was no legal
 tender law compelling people to use the coins of a particular company or mint,
 that money which best satisfied the people was most often used. Issues of questionable
 fineness were either rejected, or valued at bullion value and returned to the
 melting pot. Wherever the government failed to provide sufficient coined money
 private firms and private individuals soon filled the void, so long as they were
 not prevented from doing so by law. </p>
<p>The latter period under discussion, dated from the beginning of the Civil War,
 more closely resembles our own monetary situation today. The period was one of
 government inflation, caused generally by the budgetary strains of war. Issues
 of legal tender notes cause prices to rise, and between 1860 and 1864 prices
 doubled in the northern states. The rate of interest was appreciably affected
 in California due to the uncertainty of having debts paid off in greenbacks.
 Nevertheless, Californians avoided much of the government inflation by adhering
 to the gold standard and enacting the Specific Performance Act. Their main objection
 to the legal tender notes was to using them at an artificial value enforced by
 law. This realization defeated the purpose of the Federal government (or debtors
 who chose to cancel their debts with such notes) since their object was to obtain
 goods and services on a compulsory basis at an undervalued price. Since the power
 of the Federal government did not reach as strongly into California as into the
 North, people there were able to avoid the compulsory aspects of the tender law
 and value the government notes as they saw fit. (It is interesting to note that
 in San Francisco both paper and gold continued in use until 1914. With the outbreak
 of World War I the Federal Reserve Bank was desperate to put a stop to the handling
 of gold. By allowing the banks to pay only in $20 gold pieces when payment was
 demanded in gold, $5 and $10 pieces were gradually removed from circulation,
 and thus the effective base of gold handling was undercut.) </p>
<p>Given the demise of both private and government gold coinage, it is difficult
 to imagine how commodity money will once again assert its dominance in market
 exchanges. Yet there is a natural law at work which assures us that paper is
 not gold, despite all the statist protestations to the contrary. Both voluntaryists
 and &quot;hard money&quot; advocates need to be aware of the monetary history
 related in this article. Not only is the moral case for private coinage laid
 out, but its very existence just over a century ago proves that such a system
 was functional and practical. </p>
