        to be sure that the impact of what the FBI says reaches you, let me sum it up
        this way. First, let me make an explanation. Nobody, including the FBI, </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>says these figures
        are accurate. They are bound not to be accurate for the <span style='letter-spacing:
        -.05pt'>reason that all we have here are the crimes that have been reported.
        Obvi­</span><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>ously, many crimes are not
        reported. Additionally, there is bound to be some </span><span
        style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>increase in crime every year as long as the
        legislators stay in session. There is bound to be, because every time a new
        piece of legislation is enacted, </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.3pt'>somebody
        is bound to trip over it. And, of course, when you trip over it, you've </span><span
        style='letter-spacing:-.05pt'>violated a law. And that's going to classify you
        as a lawbreaker, hence a </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>criminal.
        You might be a minor criminal but that depends on how badly the legislature
        wanted that particular piece of legislation. The fact remains that </span>nobody
        says that these figures are accurate. There is one merit that these <span
        style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>reports have and it makes them the best
        information that we have that comes </span>out regularly in the country. Or at
        least it did until currently. They are uniform. These are uniform crime
        reports. Consequently, whatever errors <span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>are
        made are made consistently. So we have a base for comparison if nothing </span>else.</span></p>

        is to try to retaliate after the fact. I know it's comforting to believe that

        says the <span style='letter-spacing:-.05pt'>police are never around when you
        want them. We laugh about that and </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>conclude
        that the police are not very sharp. Don't blame the police. Very few crooks

        are in the vicinity. So he </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>waits and
        the police will leave presently. Then he performs the crime. That is </span><span

        real crime where injuries are inflicted. The largest category in the United
        States is business theft; that is to say, theft from employers per­<span

        is such, an anti-business, </span>anti-capitalist mentality in the land that a
        businessman is viewed as fair <span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>game by a
        great many of his employees. They simply take advantage of </span>him <span
        style='letter-spacing:-.25pt'>at every opportunity. And they don't think it's
        wrong. Some of it is petty. They </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>will
        steal a few stamps, some pencils, paperclips. They put a little gas into the </span><span
        style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>car from the company pump and they don't report
        it. They pad their expense accounts. In fact, that's almost a new form of
        literature in the United States, </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.05pt'>the
        padded expense account. They do anything and everything against the </span><span
        style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>boss and they think nothing of it. If you work for
        a grocery store, you take out </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>a half
        a ham or half a case of peaches, stick it in the car. If you work at a </span><span
        style='letter-spacing:-.3pt'>machine shop, you take a few tools or maybe a few
        machine parts. And it goes </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>on and on.
        Additionally, we've actually found whole rings of thieves profes­</span><span

        fencing the material the firm </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>is

        your friendly neighborhood pusher, who was, of course, tied in, directly or

        questionable quality that might have been cut with a strychnine, so you didn't </span><span

        dime, but you can't go up to someone and say, &quot;You know, I'm having a </span><span

        according to the figures that have been released, 60 percentthat's the </span><span

        why I said what I did. </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>There is no

        equally attractive or unattractive depending on what you think of <span
        style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>cities of 100,000. So, they're alike in all
        respects save this. Town A has a city </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.05pt'>manager
        and a mayor and a city council and the constabulary, the police </span><span
        style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>force, the jails, the courts, the judges, the
        laws, the works. What we would </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>typically
        expect today is an American town of 100,000. And Town B is the </span>same
        except it doesn't have any of those customary legal trappings.</span></p>

        own hands and he went downtown carrying a rock in his pocket. And he </span><span

        of studies in this area. Actually, your question is deep enough to take an </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>evening.
        But may I say that I have found, and I've done this myself, I've </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>served
        as an arbitrator in a couple of disputes this way. And it has worked </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.05pt'>beautifully.
        As a private citizen, the plaintiff and the defendant come to </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>me
        and here's how I've done it. I let the plaintiff tell me about the wrong. </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.2pt'>And
        I give him all the time in the world and he can keep talking as long as </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>he
        wants to and I don't care how often he repeats himself. He can call the
        defendant every name in the book. The defendant has to sit there and take </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.05pt'>it.
        In this connection, by the way, it's good if you have an additional </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>audience.
        Let the plaintiff run on, but you've got to be patient. Let him go </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.2pt'>the
        distance. When he's said it all, then you ask him to be still and you turn </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.25pt'>to
        the defendant and ask him to have his say. And he says it, and let him go </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.05pt'>without
        any interruption however long it takes. When he's through, go </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.25pt'>back
        to your plaintiff and let him do it again. When he's through, go back to </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>the
        defendant. Never interrupt. Let him say it all. Let them finish. If you keep
        that up, you will discover a very interesting thing. The periods of </span><span
        style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>tirade get less and
        less vituperative and briefer and briefer. In process, <span style='letter-spacing:
        -.1pt'>this has happened whenever I've been involved. All of a sudden, in the </span>midst
        of one of these recitations, one of the disputants says, &quot;Wait a minute. I
        see. I'm at fault.&quot; He sees and everybody else sees it. The problem becomes
        visible and then the thing is settled.</span></p>

        I </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>can't do it for society. I can

        The police take a long time to respond. Further, they often </span>come with

        is made up of punishmentsomething inflicted by authority, restitution is
        something taken away is restored and defense is to curtain (a form of

        governmental policing methods offer little or no protection for private
        citizens. Jotting figures on the blackboard behind him, LeFevres
        interpretation of FBI crime statistics show that Police are successful only 20
        percent of the time. In 1970, 2,169,300 burglaries were reported, 19 percent
        were solved, 9 percent were convicted and 3 percent of the criminals served or
        are still serving time. Meaning, LeFevre explained, if you're a burglar, you
        have an 81 percent chance of doing your burglarizing without being caught, a 91
        percent chance of not being convicted, and a 97 percent chance of not having to
        serve out your time. That's better odds than you can get in Vegas if you own

        stressed that one of the reasons why government protection does not protect is
        because, The police are hired to keep an eye on the taxpayers as potential
        criminals. In other words, The government rips people off to get together the
        money to keep people from getting ripped off.</span></p>

        solution to the protection dilemma is to stop paying <i>protection taxes</i>
        and invest the money into their own protective devices and methods from locks,
        burglar alarms, private security guards and steel bars. But LeFevres basic
        idea is to get law and order services out from under the control of the
        ineffective and chaotic public sector. There is bound to be an increase in
        crime as long as the legislature is still in session, LeFevre said in
