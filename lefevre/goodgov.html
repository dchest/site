<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.9pt;margin-right:1.45pt;margin-bottom:

line-height:13.9pt;background:white'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Robert LeFevre is one of the most
influential libertarian theoreticians and authors on the West coast. It is said
that he is mainly responsible for motivating the first major student
libertarian movement in California in the late 1960's. It was LeFevre's
presence at the libertarian Long Beach 1969 Con­ference that inspired student
leaders across California to rally behind LeFevre's Rampart College and
libertarianism.</span> <span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";
color:black'>(Professor Ludwig von Mises was the keynote speaker at the Long
Beach Conference.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Born
in Gooding, Idaho, in 1911, LeFevre's life-long love was the theater. He
attended Hamline University in St. Paul to achieve that dream, but never
graduated even though Hamline waived LeFevre's freshman English requirement
because of his ability. Hamline University told LeFevre that the combi­nation
of courses he wanted to take would not get him a degree. LeFevre replied by
saying he wanted an education instead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>In
years following his college days, he took jobs ranging from newsboy to door-to-door
salesman. When the United States entered World War II, LeFevre joined the Army
Air Force for four years. LeFevre had no real interest in the military although
he was over the draft age at the time enlisted. Publicly, he has said that he
joined the Army because it was “the only proper procedure.” He served on year
on General Lee’s occupation staff in Paris.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>After
the war, LeFevre re-entered the real estate business and soon came face to face
with government restrictions. Everywhere he turned, from the real estate
business to apartment owner to restaurateur, LeFevre confronted government
harassment. At one time, the city wanted him to install a dry standpipe for the
attachment of fire hoses. Soon he discovered that only one man was authorized
by the city government to build them, and the price was anything but inexpensive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>In
another instance, the office of Price Administration accused him of
rent-gouging. At the time, LeFevre charged $25 a month for two-room, furnished
apartments with utilities, and wanted to raise the rent to $30 a month. The
increase was to cover tax increases. “When the government raises taxes,” LeFevre
said, “that’s not a gouge, but when you try to earn money so you can pay your
taxes, that’s a gouge.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>In
1948, LeFevre went into semi-retirement for one year to study economics and
political philosophy. After discovering that government couldn’t do anything
that people couldn’t do by themselves, he decided to do something. LeFevre
turned to politics believing that the solution was to elect “good” people into
office. He ran for Congress in the 14<sup>th</sup> Congressional District as a
Republican. Since California at the time permitted cross-fling in primary
elections, LeFevre lost to Democrat Sam Yorty and fellow Republican Jack Hardy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Turned
off to politics, he worked for the United Taxpayers of California until he
landed a job with WQAM in Miami. Later he became the news director for WFTL-TV
in Fort Lauderdale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>In
1954 he became the editorial writer for the Colorado Springs Gazette which was
part of the Freedom chain newspapers owned by the Hoiles family in Santa Ana, California. A few years later he became its editor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Remaining
with the newspaper for 10 years, LeFevre started the Freedom School in 1965, as in his words, “a part time hobby.” The school was located at the base of the
wooded foothills of Colorado's Rampart Range near Larkspur. Colorado. With his
second wife Loy and his four children, they renovated three uninhabitable old
cabins. Eventually, they expanded to 14 dude - ranch - style log buildings with
526 acres.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>The
land was sold in 1966 and the operation moved to downtown Santa Ana, California. Since the move, Rampart College increasingly became the center of the West
Coast libertarian movement. Students operated many of Rampart College's
ventures, which included a newsletter, a large, short-lived magazine named <i>Pine
Tree</i>, seminars, publish­ing pamphlets and books, and sponsoring conferences
like the Left-Right Festival of Liberation at USC in February, 1970. It
attracted hundreds of dropouts from both the Left and Right, including such
speakers as Karl Hess, Carl Oglesby, Phillip Abbott Luce, Dr. F. A. Harper,
Lowell Ponte, Dr. John Hospers as well as Robert LeFevre. Organized by Dana
Rohrabacher, Shawn Steel, Jean Berkman (Doug Kennell) and others with
assistance from Rampart College, USC Liber­tarian Conferences are still being
held today.*</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>By
1973 Sy Leon, author of <i>None of the Above</i>, became the new president of
Rampart College. LeFevre retired to write books and publish his quarterly <i>LeFevre's
Journal</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>LeFevre
is the author of <i>This Bread is Mine</i>, <i>The Nature of Man and His
Government, The Philosophy of Owner­ship, Lift Her Up, Tenderly, </i>and a
small booklet entitled <i>The Libertarian</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I wondered
where this remarkable person had been hiding. Bob is a dynamic speaker and
fortunately many of us had a chance to hear him again last month as he spoke at
the libertarian conference (Future of Freedom Conference, 1977) at USC and
again he gave us another really beautiful talk! I would have to use the word
inspirational to describe it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I never had
the chance myself to be in a class that Bob has taught and that is my loss. I
noticed that among those who have been in his classes, there is some sort of
apotheosis that takes place. You become more than a mere mortal, Bob; so I am
going to have to take a class from you sometime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I had a chance
to be in Bob’s home a few years ago. I remember two thing about this; one, the
really genuine warmth and hospitality that he and Loy extended to everyone
there. It was beautiful evening. Really beautiful. And another thing I remember
were the books. There were over 10,000 books along the balcony circling the
living room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Bob has a rich
and varied background. He has a skeleton in his closet also. We won’t hold this
against him. I found out last month that he ran for Congress as a Republican
many years ago. But no one is perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Bob is also
sort of minority with our minority libertarian movement. He is an “autarchist.”
I hesitate to use labels but I believe this is the proper word. For those of you
who are not familiar with it, I am sure you will know more about it before the
evening is over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>He has done
television, radio and newspaper work all over the United States. I suppose most
of us have known of him through Rampart College in Santa Ana where he did much
of his educational work. Currently, he is giving one week seminars all over the
country. In fact, he is booked up at least a year in advance. I know that there
is one place where he hasn’t spoken recently and I know he would like to, and
that is right here in Southern California.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I also would
like to mention his new book—<i>The Power of Congress</i>. In addition to his
writing, Bob publishes <i>LeFevre’s Journal</i>. I am sure many of you are
already on his mailing list. The caption on the masthead of <i>LeFevre’s
Journal</i> states that it “is published every quarter approximately in Orange, California. It is not for sale, but it is supplied to those who are dedicated to
human liberty and those who are dedicated make it possible.</span></p>

an automobile put together under very rigid, quality control specifications so

efficiency. And if the one I buy isn't, I'm going to scream my head off. I want

hard. But then you get something that is worthwhile. That's the second type of
organization. And, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have that regardless of
government. It's called &quot;the business&quot; and it's based on what can be
called &quot;economic necessity.&quot;</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Okay,
so these are two of the basic organizations that we are going to have.
Incidentally, government has gotten into the act on business. Well, you know
that! But I mean in another way. Sometimes government has issued orders and
even helped finance certain types of businesses which they wanted to encourage.
You know what happens when they do that? Investors try to find some other place
to put their money. If the government favors it, investors will be certain it's
a loser.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>And
then sometimes the government comes out and says &quot;We forbid you to produce
this.&quot; You know what we do? We produce it anyway. We call it a &quot;Black
Market.&quot; A black market is just a free market driven underground by some
silly regulation put out by a bureaucrat somewhere. That's all it is. Of
course, we call it a criminal act because the government doesn't know the
difference between a criminal and a free man. Both of them confuse the people
in government.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>And
then there is a <span style='letter-spacing:1.1pt'>third</span> type of
organization that arises out of the nature of man and the nature of the world
in which we live. This third type is probably not as well known as the others.
We are only today beginning to study it in depth. This organization, for want
of a better name, I would like to call &quot;the fraternity&quot; or &quot;the
sorority,&quot; &quot;the brotherhood,&quot; or &quot;the club,&quot; if you'll
pardon the term. What I am getting at is this. Human beings by their nature are
fundamentally communicative creatures. Perhaps you haven't thought about that
particularly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>From
the moment of your birth and all through your life you are going to be engaged
in an almost frantic effort to communicate with other people the unique fact of
your own individual existence. There is no one else quite like you. You are
unique. And you are very eager to let others know about that. It's fundamental
with us; with every one of us. In consequence, we human beings have developed a
vocal language. No, we have developed hundreds of vocal languages. We have
written languages. We have a language of facial expression. We have a language
of gesture. We have what we now call “body language” which we are only
beginning to understand. Our posture, our stance, the things we wear, the
places we go, the people we associate with—we employ all of these to constantly
scream, &quot;Look at me! I'm unique. Here I am! I exist in this one place in
the universe and that's me!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>What
is the result of this behavior? The result of this, ladies and gentlemen, is
that I want to talk to people I can reach with whatever communicative talents I
may have. How do I do that? In this world there are literally thousands of
things that take our attention. And the consequence is, I find, that there are
people who get together, for example, because they want to communicate about,
say, yachting. So we have yacht clubs. And people like to communicate with
others of similar interest. &quot;Hey, look at me! I'm a yacht captain! I own a
yacht.&quot; They want to talk to other people who have yachts because they
have &quot;yachts and yachts to talk about.&quot; Terrible! But it's what
happens to me because my philosophy makes me happy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>There
will be people who get together to organize the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts
or the Women's Sewing Circle or the Chowder and Marching Society, if you like
chowder and like to march, or they will even organize a libertarian club or
some other thing. Why? Because these are people who communicate with you in the
areas of your interest. How are these groups organized? Well, when you organize
these clubs, many are organized under a charter—a constitution—if you'll pardon
the expression, and many have by-laws. It's all spelled out. The dues are so
much a month, a year, or whatever. It's all very carefully set down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>But,
ladies and gentlemen, it's still a voluntary organization: nobody has to join
it. You are not compelled to get in. And if you're in and you don't like it,
you are not compelled to stay in. You can get out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>So
what do we have? We have three basic types of organization: the family, the
business, and the fraternity. Each is strictly voluntary. You get into them
because you like them. You move into them, in other words, because there are
plus factors in it for you. If you find that the plus factors you anticipated
aren't there, then you leave. And it's up to you whether you stay or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span

here's the interesting point. You and I spend about 98 percent of our time, our
waking time, in the family, the business, or the fraternity. What else do we
have? That's where we live. That's it. Aside from these, you're driving
somewhere.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Well,
ladies and gentlemen, I think psychiatry and psychology have reached a
consensus in this area. That's unusual in itself, and should be noted. But the
fact is that any person who is engaged in a perfectly proper pursuit and who
knows within his own heart and mind that he is doing a perfectly proper thing
suddenly confronts a bully who says to him, &quot;I'm not going to let you do
what you're doing: you are going to do what I want you to do, and I am not
going to let you keep the money you earned. That's my money. You are only good
enough to earn it; I know how to spend it better than you do.&quot; And when
this force interferes with you, you experience what is called
&quot;frustration.&quot; That's the technical term. You're mad as hell. But to
express it politely, you're frustrated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>What
does frustration do? Well, when you are frustrated by someone larger than you
are, and you cannot strike back at him, you sort of bottle up your feelings.
This creature has made you furious, but he is too big to attack. You know,
you're facing King Kong. So, what do you do? You're pushed down, repressed, but
you're seething inside. You don't like it. But this process repeats: it goes
on. Again and again you find yourself frustrated. You get a job. Why? So that
you can earn some money. Why? So that you can buy some of the things that you
need to stay alive. You begin to have plans, dreams, things you want to
achieve. And here is a 600-pound gorilla standing on your front doorstep <span
style='letter-spacing:.9pt'>telling</span> you what you can and cannot do. You
become frus­trated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Here's
how it works. I'll just give you a quick and very graphic illustration. A man
goes to work, a nice fellow. He feels good: he had a nice weekend. He starts
doing his job, whatever it is. The boss comes in. And for no reason that this
fellow can observe, the boss bawls him out. Maybe the boss had a bad weekend,
whatever. This young fellow now experiences frustration. Of course he could
tell the boss off, but he would probably lose his job. So he doesn't tell the
boss off; he just sits there and takes it. Okay. The minute the boss's back is
turned this fellow is seething and the emotional upheaval goes on until
somebody comes in that has less authority than be has. He jumps him. He gets it
out of his system and lays it on the next fellow. Well, he, too, has no
recourse but to bottle it up. And finally when he goes home he walks in and
there is his wife. She's smaller than he is. So he lights into her. And tells
her what's what. And, you know, she doesn't want to get knocked down, so she
bottles it up. But the kid comes in, so she lays it on the kid. And what can he
do? He waits until the dog shows up and he kicks the dog. The dog yelps, runs
down the street and bites the boss who lives in the next block. And that ties
it together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span

have a self-perpetuating mechanism that continues to feed on itself until all
of us get increasingly angry and distressed at what the government is doing. We
feel absolutely helpless and shut out. And we don't know what we can do. That's
one of the reasons why I cautioned you at the outset; please don't be angry.
Our job is to think the problem through and to see what we can do about it. But
let's think it through first. For tonight we are going to think. Later if you
want to do something: that's something else again.</span></p>

because politics is the </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";

Politics is a method—some call it a </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

call it an art. </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";

style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>a monopoly of coercion can be obtained and

means that the government </span><span style='letter-spacing:.7pt'>I'm</span><span

young fellow. So we put him at the </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

of the triangle and gave him power. We cheered him and the energy of </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.1pt'>our support revved up and became power in use. Once that
topmost position </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";
color:black;letter-spacing:-.2pt'>was occupied by the ruler, then he began to
crack the whip and power flowed </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>from
the top down. We put the king in an exalted position, but he was a nice </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.25pt'>fellow when we put him there. Then he began to rule. And
he said, &quot;I want her </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.05pt'>arrested. I want
him eaten.&quot; And various other orders were given. And we carried out his
wishes. Presently, we begin to say, &quot;What happened to our </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.2pt'>king? You know, when we put him up there he was a nice
guy. But now, he's </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";
color:black;letter-spacing:-.25pt'>hurting us.&quot; And we begin to conspire
against him. And pretty soon we do one </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.35pt'>of
two things. We either endured it until he died or we got rid of him one way or </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.1pt'>another. Sometimes we chased him off his throne and
sometimes we killed </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";
color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>him before he could get out the door. But we
got rid of him. In the meantime </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>we
placed another fellow in the wings because he has already assured us by </span><span

letter-spacing:-.25pt'>saying, &quot;I'm going to be a good king.&quot; We
believed it. So we crowned him and </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

as a person would act if his </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>mother barked.
And finally we said, &quot;Ah, the problem is not the man, the problem is the
structure. We built it wrong. We shouldn't put anybody at the </span><span

happens when you get an oligarchy is </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

color:black'>them into direct dictatorship. This is not because of the nature
of man. It's because of the nature of the political method in structures of the
type I am talking <span style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>about. We have played
around with this and the result was exactly the </span><span style='letter-spacing:

</span><span style='letter-spacing:-.05pt'>the man on the top, with power
rolling down to oppress, intimidate, terrify </span><span style='letter-spacing:

that. Let's get </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>something closer to

people at the next level and so </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>on
up, until you ascend into heaven. And then, of course, when you arrive at </span>the

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Now
ladies and gentlemen, let's take the next point. To have a government de facto,
there must be more than a ruler. In addition, you have to obtain a very special
reaction which I am going to give by its exact name. It is called “sanction.&quot;
But it is a particular type of sanction. I am indebted to Ayn Rand for the
phrase. She didn't use it quite as I am going to, but she said it better than I
could have. She said it is &quot;the sanction of the victim.&quot; And I want
to make that point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>First
before dealing with the sanction of the victim, let me sketch out a few of the
characteristics that accompany all rulers sooner or later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>Whenever
a person decides that he wishes to be a ruler, he develops certain
psychological trails. In a few cases in history, ladies and gentlemen, we have
had a man suddenly thrust into a position of rulership to which he did not
aspire. When it happens, the same thing occurs, but there is a little lapse of
time before you can detect it. But all rulers and would-be rulers have the same
traits sooner or later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>What
they develop, first of all, is an enormous self-confidence. They <span
style='letter-spacing:.9pt'>believe</span> they are right. They believe that
their opinions are objectively right. Their view is &quot;The View.&quot; If
you differ, you are in error. I might say, many of us have this characteristic
to some degree. Most of us, by the time we get past the age of twelve or
thirteen, are pretty sure we know what's what. So we all have that characteristic,
but there is a very peculiar thing that happens to the psychology of the
would-be ruler. Whereas most of us might feel very confident about the validity
of our opinions, we also have a mediating feeling of weakness. Most of us find
ourselves to consist of a bundle of good points and bad points, but we do
detect failings in certain places. And if we are thinking as ordinary people,
we usually find that, while we think that we are right, we also feel that
somehow we don't have the <span style='letter-spacing:.85pt'>ability</span> of
convincing others of just how right we are. And that we feel inadequate while
also feeling confident. This keeps us in balance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>But
if you are a ruler or a would-be ruler, when you should have the feeling of
inadequacy, you don't. What you have is a feeling that the reason you can't
convince the other party is his fault, not yours. You're right, and he's wrong.
He's not only wrong, but he's stupid. Because your position is absolutely right
and he should see it. It's not your fault that you cannot explain it. It's his
fault because he doesn't grasp it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>That
leads to a very interesting phenomenon called sublimation. The ruler buries his
feelings of inadequacy. He can't admit it, even to himself. This leads the
ruler into a position where he attains what could be called &quot;self-righteousness.&quot;
If you don't agree with him, then he is justified in doing whatever is
necessary to bring you <span style='letter-spacing:.9pt'>into</span> line. If
he has to tax you, that's all right. If he has to fine you, <span
style='letter-spacing:.85pt'>that's</span> all right. If he has to put you on
the rack and torture you or whatever, it's quite all right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>The
ruler is self-righteous. He has to be. The consequence is that he can order a
country into war, plunge it <span style='letter-spacing:.75pt'>into</span> a
series of atrocities, command assassinations, mayhem and destruction. Then he
can go to bed and sleep like a baby with a clear conscience. Because he's
right. And in the end the evil he does will all add up to good. So this is the
characteristic that you find in rulers, sooner or later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.25pt'>We had a case here in the United States, where a fellow
became our top man </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";
color:black;letter-spacing:-.3pt'>and he had never planned on it. You know, the
mantle was dropped on him. He </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.05pt'>never quite
recovered. And you could see for the first few months that he </span><span

style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'> stunned by what had happened. But then the </span><span
style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>gleam began to appear in the eye. You have
witnessed it. Anyway, that's the </span>characteristic of the ruler: self-righteousness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Let's return to the point I left in mid-air. You have to
have sanction of the </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";
color:black;letter-spacing:-.1pt'>victim, as well as a ruler. And the sanction
of the victim, ladies and gentle­</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>men,
is this: the government must have the approval of an enormous section </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.2pt'>of the entire population. I don't care what kind of
government it is—democ­</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";
color:black;letter-spacing:-.05pt'>racy, dictatorship, anything at all—it
doesn't matter. Obviously, any ruler </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;letter-spacing:-.25pt'>or
would-be ruler can get a following by promising goodies to people. He can </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>say,
&quot;If you back me, I'll let you eat at my table, and there will always be
crumbs that I can provide for my loyal followers.&quot; So people will line up <span
style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>behind him, and you have that type of sanction—the
sanction or approval of </span>those who are joyfully following this particular
would-be leader.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.1pt'>But that won't give you a government. All that provides
is a faction. Government is a very peculiar hybrid that not only has to have
the approval </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";
color:black;letter-spacing:-.3pt'>of those who favor </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black'>it,<span
style='letter-spacing:-.3pt'> but also it has to win the approval of those who
know the </span><span style='letter-spacing:-.25pt'>government is going to
injure them. And they have to approve even their own </span>injury. That's what
is meant by &quot;sanction of the victim.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in;background:white'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.1pt'>You know you're going to be victimized, but you approve
anyway. That's </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";

victim, it <span style='letter-spacing:-.05pt'>cannot stand; because a
government is more than just power alone. Power </span>alone is the military
and the military can always conquer, but conquering <span style='letter-spacing:

sanction of </span>the very people the government proposes to shaft.</span></p>

close. And it just hap­</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";

know what happened? An American politician would say. &quot;Now wait just a
minute. If it weren't for us, the Russians would come in and they would impose
communism on you. And do you know what would happen? When they imposed
communism, you would be forced to work where they told you to, at a wage that
they would decide, and you'd be drafted into their armies. And if you
disobeyed, you'd be tried and sent lo <span style='letter-spacing:1.15pt'>their</span>
prisons. Anything could happen. So, support us and we'll tell you where to work
and what you are going to earn and draft you into our armies. And if you

warmongering capitalists in America? You better not get fresh with us. We are
Mother Russia. You support us because if it weren't for us, the American
imperialists would be over here and they would impose capitalism on you. And
you know what would happen? The big corporations would tell you where to work,
and they would tell you how much you could earn, and they would compel you to
do as they said. And they would draft you into <span style='letter-spacing:

punish you, and might even shoot you, so do as we say and we'll protect you

Americans come in. That would be terrible. If we gel shafted, let it be a

letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Robert LeFevre is one of the most powerful lecturers and
authors in the United States. His lecture “Good Government: Hope or Illusion?”
at Santa Ana College is a classic in wit and common sense which has made
LeFevre almost a legend in his own time.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Never before has anyone defined the role of government
so brutally precise. “Government is,” LeFevre repeated twice to the audience,
“a group of people who sell retributive justice to the inhabitants of a limited
geographic area at monopolistic prices.” LeFevre continued, “Politics is the
method employed in the power structures by means of which a monopoly of
coercion can be obtained and maintained…This is what we can do without in the
interest of law and order.”</span></p>

letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Founder and former president of Rampart College, LeFevre
constantly reminded his listeners that he is an “autarchist,” and not an
anarchist because he strongly supports law and order. And since government is
usually unlawful and disorderly, LeFevre pointed out, the need for government
has few merits if any.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;
letter-spacing:-.15pt'>As for good government, LeFevre contended that there is
no such thing as good government. “That is a contradiction in terms as
ridiculous as ‘constructive rape.’”</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:black;

for any libertarian library.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>This booklet was
re-published by Freeland Press, P.O. Box 22231, Carmel, CA 93922.  Many of the
ideas expressed in this booklet can be found in Robert LeFevre's magnum opus
book, <i>Fundamentals of Liberty</i>, which is available at <a
href="http://www.lksamuels.com">www.lksamuels.com</a>. Considered the
definitive work on the nature of liberty, <i>The Fundamentals of Liberty</i> is
a combination of over 25 years of work as a lecturer, author and president of
Rampart College. The book took five years to complete and was finished only a
few weeks before LeFevre’s death in 1986.</span></p>
