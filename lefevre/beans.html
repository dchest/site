<h2>Abstain From Beans </h2>
<p>By Robert LeFevre &#8212; (1911 - 1986)</p>
<p> In ancient Athens, those who admired the Stoic philosophy of individualism
  took as their motto: &quot;Abstain from Beans.&quot; The phrase had a precise
  reference. It meant: don't vote. Balloting in Athens occurred by dropping various
  colored beans into a receptacle.</p>
<p> To vote is to express a preference. There is nothing implicitly evil in choosing.
  All of us in the ordinary course of our daily lives vote for or against dozens
  of products and services. When we vote for (buy) any good or service, it follows
  that by salutary neglect we vote against the goods or services we do not choose
  to buy. The great merit of market place choosing is that no one is bound by
  any other persons selection. I may choose Brand X. But this cannot prevent you
  from choosing Brand Y.</p>
<p> When we place voting into the framework of politics, however, a major change
  occurs. When we express a preference politically, we do so precisely because
  we intend to bind others to our will. Political voting is the legal method we
  have adopted and extolled for obtaining monopolies of power. Political voting
  is nothing more than the assumption that might makes right. There is a presumption
  that any decision wanted by the majority of those expressing a preference must
  be desirable, and the inference even goes so far as to presume that anyone who
  differs from a majority view is wrong or possibly immoral.</p>
<p> But history shows repeatedly the madness of crowds and the irrationality of
  majorities. The only conceivable merit relating to majority rule lies in the
  fact that if we obtain monopoly decisions by this process, we will coerce fewer
  persons than if we permit the minority to coerce the majority. But implicit
  in all political voting is the necessity to coerce some so that all are controlled.
  The direction taken by the control is academic. Control as a monopoly in the
  hands of the state is basic.</p>
<p> In times such as these, it is incumbent upon free men to reexamine their most
  cherished, long-established beliefs. There is only one truly moral position
  for an honest person to take. He must refrain from coercing his fellows. This
  means that he should refuse to participate in the process by means of which
  some men obtain power over others. If you value your right to life, liberty,
  and property, then clearly there is every reason to refrain from participating
  in a process that is calculated to remove the life, liberty, or property from
  any other person. Voting is the method for obtaining legal power to coerce others.
