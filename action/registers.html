<h2>You Must Cheat on Your Taxes to Survive</h2>
<h3>By Anonymous</h3>
</center>
The most basic and important lesson I learned
while growing up [in my father’s store] was that you
must cheat on your taxes to succeed or even survive
in business, and that most everyone who could, did
so. It all began when I realized we treated the front
“cash” register different from the “back” cash
register. After a little persistent questioning, my father
said that we paid taxes on one, but not necessarily
the other. He explained that if we paid taxes on every
dollar of sales, we would barely break even, and that
if we went out of business both we and our customers
would be worse off. The meaning of this was clear
to me and I understood its implications. This was not
stealing. It was our money and if we gave it to the
government they would just go and build more urban
renewal [or spend it in ways different than those
who paid it would have chosen]. Getting “let in on”
the family business made my job even more
enjoyable, and I would regularly divert sales to the
tax-free register.<br/><br/>
As I learned more about our operation, it seemed
like everything we did violated some government rule
or other, but none of the regulations - from recycling
prescription bottles to the location and storage of
cocaine - made sense. We never got caught and never
got sued. I never heard a customer complain and we
had plenty of happy long-term customers of all races
and creeds.<br/><br/>
