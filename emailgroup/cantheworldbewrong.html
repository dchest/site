<h2>Can The Whole World Be Wrong and We Be Right?
</h2>
<h4>by Carl Watner</h4>
</center>


 In an interesting commentary titled "Communism for Conservatives," Gary North points out "that virtually the
whole world" (meaning every national government) has adopted and practices at least 30% of the Communist Manifesto
of 1848. See <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north882/html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north882/html</a>.

<br><br>


   Specifically he refers to the following planks of the Manifesto:


<br><br>

            2. A heavy or progressive or graduated income tax.<br>

            5. Centralization of credit by means of a national bank.<br>


          10. Free education for all children in public schools.<br><br>




As North writes:<br><br>




            Every nation has a graduated income tax.<br>

            Central banks are all officially state banks.<br>

            Tax-funded educational systems are universal.<br>


<br>

   Who else besides those calling ourselves voluntaryists rejects these points on principle? As we see it:

          All taxation (whether it is graduated or not) is theft.

         Central banking, the monopolization of credit, andlegal tender laws all

            violate the natural right of individuals to choose what they shall use for

            money.

         Public schools should be rejected because they rely on taxation for

            funding and are owned and operated by the government.

<br><br>


Can the whole world be wrong and we be right? Yes. As Solzhenitsyn said, "One word of truth outweighs the world!"
