TUCKER AND HIS PERIODICAL: <i>LIBERTY</i> Part II</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">CARL WATNER</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Baltimore, Maryland</font> <br>
 <br></p>
<p align="justify"> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Liberty</i>
truly touched on nearly all of the pressing social questions of its
era.  Space was devoted to articles about free love, marriage and
divorce, and sexual relations among men and women. Even the woman suffrage
movement came under attack: &quot;Women are human beings, and-consequently
have all the natural rights that any human beings can have.  They
have just as good a right to 'make laws' as men have, and no better;
AND THAT IS JUST NO RIGHT AT ALL.&quot; (22-4)  Mormon polygamy,
pornography and postal censorship were also discussed.  The Chinese
immigration issue was mentioned at times.  Freethought was always
advocated and the tyranny and cultism of religion nearly always denounced.
Tucker proudly reprinted in <i>Liberty </i>
and his private press the English Anarchist classics, such as Spooner's <i>
Natural Law, Letter to Thomas Bayard, </i>
and <i>A Letter to Grover Cleveland, </i>
Auberon Herbert's <i>A Politician in Sight of Haven</i>, Edmund Burke's <i>
Vindication of Natural Society</i>, Stephen Pearl Andrews' <i>Science
of Society</i> and his discussion of <i>Love, Marriage, and Divorce</i>,
as well as quoting excerpts from such writers as Nietzsche, Proudhon,
and Stirner.  Tucker also made <i>Liberty</i> serve as a forum
for publishing and publicizing what he called &quot;advanced literature&quot;,
by which he meant &quot;the literature which, in religion and morals,
leads away from superstition, which, in politics, leads away from government,
and which, in art, leads away from tradition&quot;. (391-4) </font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Tucker
was ambitious and promoted many literary ventures alongside his Anarchist
journalism.  He had agents in different parts of the world selling <i>
Liberty </i>and his other literary wares.  He had occasional foreign
correspondents, such as Vilfredo Pareto, George Bernard Shaw, and John
Henry Mackay, submit their evaluations of Anarchist developments to <i>
Liberty's</i> readers. He maintained especially close contact with the
English Individualist-Anarchist movement and carried on extensive correspondence
with the main English figures, such as Auberon Herbert, Wordsworth Donisthorpe,
John Badcock, J. H. Levy, and J. Greevz Fisher  Other American
associates and correspondents of <i>Liberty,</i> such as Henry Appleton,
James L. Walker, Joseph Labadie, Victor Yarros, Stephen Byington, Alan
and Florence Kelly, John Kelly, Gertrude Kelly, George and Emma Schumm,
Francis Tandy, Henry Cohen, and J. Wm. Lloyd formed the often changing
nuclei of Tucker's circle. </font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Among
Tucker's other notable projects were the publication of <i>Instead of
a Book</i> in 1893 and the publication of <i>Liberty</i> in German for
a short time.  He promoted the formation of an Anarchist Letter
Writing Corps under the auspices of Byington and sold and printed sheets
filled with Anarchist slogans.  He published such books as Zola's <i>
Modern Marriage,</i> Eltzbacher's Anarchism, and not coincidentally
Stirner's <i>The Ego and His Own.  </i>
The appearance of this later book was, in Tucker's opinion, the most
notable contribution on behalf of Anarchism that he had made in his
30-year career. (397-1)  Stirner was one of the three great Anarchists
in 19th century literature, according to Tucker; the other two being
Proudhon and Ibsen. He constantly strived to call attention to all three
both in <i>Liberty</i> and wider literary circles. (393-11)  His
New York bookstore eventually came to house a large collection of literature
that made for &quot;Egoism in Philosophy, Anarchism in Politics, and
Iconoclasm in Art.&quot; (399-2) </font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Yet
for all his boldness and greatness, Tucker and <i>Liberty</i> still
leave something to be desired. Did Tucker and his editorial columns
in <i>Liberty</i> present a true and consistent version of Anarchy?
Of course it is easy to criticize doctrine nearly a century old, but
there is much in Tucker that is still valid, as well as much that is
still as wrong as the day it was published. In spite of Tucker's eventual
deviations, his life-long emphasis on individual sovereignty and the
non-invasive individual is well-founded. </font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As
Libertarians and Anarchists today we might accept the philosophy of
egoism that Tucker came to espouse (namely, that might makes right in
the absence of mutual agreement).  Tucker, himself, recognized
the law of equal liberty as being the essence of Anarchism; but his
own defense of this social convention seems circular, for it amounts
to the statement that we are Anarchists because we are Anarchists. (123-5)
Or else we might adopt an alternative defense of Anarchism, such as
one which has been outlined by Murray Rothbard in his writings and which
hinges on the twin axioms of self-ownership (the absolute right of each
person to own his or her own mind and body) and homesteading (the absolute
right of each person to own previously unused natural resources which
they have in some way occupied or transformed).  Tucker's main
challenge to the moralists was to demand to know why one is bound not
to injure or invade another.  What obligation exists, in the absence
of any mutual agreement, to refrain from initiating violence?
I think the answer is primarily logical and epistemological in nature.
Invasion violates the axioms of self-ownership and homesteading.
The invader clearly acts on the axiom that he controls his own life,
yet in coercing others he plainly denies it.  The resort to violence
is a confession of imbecility.  Invasion is anti-life and the invader,
under the moralist's theory, loses his own rights (to life and property)
to the extent that he has committed an aggression. Thus to answer
Tucker, the obligation to refrain from initiating violence is found
in the real world around us. Anyone who acts so as to deny the validity
of these axioms must sooner or later fail and suffer disaster.
As Tucker himself wrote, early in his career, &quot;It is better to
suffer great inconveniences than the evils engendered by the violation
of individual rights.&quot; (37-4) </font> <br></p>
<p align="justify"> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Of
course, Tucker came to disagree with this position. He called that person
who would enforce the drowning man's contract a person &quot;with justice
on the brain, a man who would do justice though the heavens fall.&quot;
(344-4)  We can only speculate as to whether his rule of expediency
would succeed or not, but as applied to individual lives we can make
a comparison, which however may be an unfair one.  Tucker retired
to Europe soon after the fire of 1908 and spent the next 30 years of
his life mostly apart from the Anarchist movement.  In fact we
might say that while <i>Liberty</i> existed Anarchism blazed in glory,
but when Tucker retired the flames soon returned to embers.  By
contrast, Lysander Spooner, definitely a moralist and natural right
defender of Anarchism and therefore an opponent of Tucker's, became
steadily more radical and libertarian as he grew older.  Each person
must be left to judge the effect of historical circumstances on these
two individuals, hut their differing philosophies of Anarchism must
also be taken into consideration when viewing the outcome of their lives. </font> <br>
</p>
<p align="justify"> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To
evaluate Tucker in terms of current day libertarian thinking, we would
have to say this: We concur with Tucker that no living person owes any
other living person any thing in the absence of voluntary agreement;
hut tile obligation to refrain from initiating violence is not a positive
duty.  It is a negative one.  It is something which we should
not do, not something we should do.  We can stand by and see a
man murdered or a woman raped (170-4); but we cannot claim that there
are times when it is necessary for the Anarchist to become Archist,
and to abandon the guiding rule of his life and to coerce the noninvasive
individual. (307-3) </font> <br> <br></p>
