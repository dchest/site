<h2>“Oh, Ye Are For Anarchy!”:<br>
Consent Theory in the Radical Libertarian Tradition</h2>
<h4>by Carl Watner<br>1986</h4>
</center>
Part II<br><br>
(Much like the assumption that if one's parents are English, one's allegiance and citizenship are automatically British.) &quot;In Thoreau's day, the church taxed each member of its congregation, and the taxes were billed and collected by the town officials.&quot;[l18]  The First Parish Church (Unitarian) of Concord &quot;taxed&quot; Thoreau in 1840, but he refused to pay.  The tax was finally disallowed when at the request of some of the selectmen, Thoreau agreed to present them with the following statement: &quot;Know all men by these presents, that I, Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which I have not joined.&quot;  Thoreau adds that &quot;if I had known how to name them, I should then have signed off in detail from all the societies which I never signed on to; but I did not know where to find a complete list.”[119]  One honestly wonders whether Thoreau ever considered himself as joining the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?
<br><br>
Thoreau's friend and confidant Charles Lane, in his series of letters published in 1843 on &quot;A Voluntary Political Government,&quot; made a number of interesting comments about the meaning of citizenship.  In a discussion of consent, Lane points out that the preamble to the state constitution of Massachusetts reads: &quot;The body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals.&quot;  If this be the true case, Lane argues, then his advocacy of &quot;voluntary political government&quot; entails a principle already embraced by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in her very own constitution. As Lane explains,
<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All, therefore, on behalf of which I am asserting may be summed up <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as the restoration of the primary constitutional principle.  I give <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
no strained or unusual value to the word &quot;voluntary&quot; on <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this occasion. Either it means choice, or it means nothing at all. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If it does not assert the free voluntariness of every individual <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
who comes into &quot;the body politic&quot; it signifies nothing; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or at least nothing which common sense can lay hold of.  If the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
voluntariness is to be confined to those who have the power, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
they are to be at liberty to force every one into the association,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
then I must esteem this word &quot;voluntary&quot; to be a solemn <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mockery; and the sooner it is erased, and the term &quot;forced&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
put in its stead, the sooner the words of the constitution harmonize <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with the idea of its framers, and be at one with the very practice of <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
its supporters.[120]
<br><br>

The nineteenth century thinker who, perhaps more than any other, elaborated on the significance and implications of government by consent was Lysander Spooner.  Spooner (1808-1887) was a constitutional lawyer, abolitionist, and freethinker who became progressively more radical as be grew older.  In an appendix to his <i>Essay on Trial by Jury</i>, published in 1852, Spooner noted (much like Molyneux and others) that it was a principle of the common law that no persons could be taxed without their personal consent.  To Spooner, even before he saw the governmental carnage and atrocities of the Civil War, &quot;taxation without consent&quot; was &quot;as plainly robbery&quot; whether it was enforced by one man against millions, or enforced by millions against one man who did not consent.  &quot;Neither the numbers engaged in the act, nor the different characters they assume as a cover for the act&quot; could ever alter the fact that property was being forcefully taken from at least one person against his will. Spooner defended the principle of &quot;no taxation without consent&quot; in the following manner:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the government can take a man's money without his consent there is no limit <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to the additional tyranny it may practice upon him. . . . It is therefore a <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
first principle, a very 'sine qua non’ of political freedom, that a man can <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
be taxed only by his personal consent. . . . Government have no more right, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in nature or reason to 'assume' a man's consent to be protected by them, and <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to he taxed for that protection, when he has given no actual consent, than a <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fire or marine insurance company have to assume a man's consent to be protected <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
by them, and to pay the premium, when his actual consent has never been given.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To take a man's property without his consent is robbery; and to assume his <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
consent where no actual consent is given, makes the taking none the less robbery.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If it did, the highwayman has the same right to assume a man's consent to part <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with his purse, that any other man, or body of men, can have.  And his assumption <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
would afford as much moral justification for his robbery as does a like assumption, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
on the part of the government, for taking a man's property without his consent.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The government's pretence of protecting him, as an equivalent for the taxation <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
affords no justification.[121]

<br><br>
After the Civil War, Spooner wrote a series of pamphlets called <i>No Treason</i>.  According to Spooner in these essays, governments and nations, if they can be said to rightfully exist at all, can exist only by consent, and this means: &quot;the separate individual consent of every man who is required to contribute, either by taxation or personal service, to the support of the government. . . . Either the separate individual consent of every man who is required to aid, in any way, in supporting the government is necessary, or the consent of no one is necessary.&quot;[122]
<br><br>
In <i>No Treason</i>, No. 2, Spooner argued that &quot;either 'taxation without consent is robbery' or it is not.  If it is not, then any number of men who choose, may at any time associate; call themselves a government, assume absolute authority over all weaker than themselves; plunder them at will; and kill them if they resist.  If, on the other hand, 'taxation without consent is robbery,' it necessarily follows that every man who has not consented to be taxed, has the same natural right to defend his property against a tax-gatherer, that he has to defend it against a highwayman.&quot; [123]
<br><br>
In his final pamphlet of this series, <i>No Treason</i>, No. 6, &quot;The Constitution of No Authority,&quot; Spooner broke new ground by demolishing the theory of tacit consent.  Spooner argued that merely living in a certain geographic area under control of a government, or voting in government elections, in no way implied one's consent to the government of that territory.  Elections mean nothing; for Spooner showed that a majority of people never vote, and of those who do, the number supporting the elected candidates is so small (as a percentage of the population) as to be ludicrous. &quot;Elections are secret; therefore, you cannot call representatives legal agents, since they do not know specifically whom they do represent.&quot;  Therefore, having voted in an election in no formal way demonstrates that one consented to anything.  &quot;On the question of the Constitution itself, no vote ever had been taken, and as a legal contract the Constitution has no validity.&quot;[124]  According to Spooner,
<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Constitution was never signed, nor agreed to, by anybody, as a contract, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and therefore never bound anybody, and is now binding upon nobody; and is,  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
moreover, such a one as no people can ever hereafter be expected to consent  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to, except as they may be forced to do so at the point of the bayonet.[125] <br>

<br><br>
The anarchistic implications of all this should be quite clear.  The state has no right to raise any taxes except as they are &quot;voluntary&quot; contributions or &quot;contractual&quot; obligations for services rendered.[126]  In fact the historical origin of taxation demonstrates its relationship to the idea of consent.  At least some forms of taxation &quot;were matters of voluntary grant,&quot; but &quot;their history is bound up with the gradual growth of the right of the majority to bind the individual.&quot;  During the reign of Henry III (1227-1258), an example is cited of a nobleman claiming immunity from a tax &quot;on the ground that he as an individual had not consented to its levy.&quot;[127]  As another commentator has pointed out, &quot;consent no longer effectively safeguards the sanctity of private property if it ceases to be personal and individual.&quot;  Yet the very growth of such expressions as &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; tended to purposefully obscure this important point.  Once the parliamentary practice became accepted by which &quot;electors appointed representatives, or proxies, to give consent in their name,&quot; the sense of individual consent to taxation &quot;inevitably lost ground.&quot;[128]
<br><br>
In its extreme form the doctrine of consent signifies that a man is bound only by what he consents to.  If individual consent is the only rightful source of power, the question must be raised why &quot;even a single objector should be coerced, possibly against his own conscience.&quot;[129]  This &quot;anarchial principle&quot; has always been embraced by radical libertarians, and certainly no one belabored the point more than did Spooner.&quot;[130]  As one of the major contributors to the development of the proprietary theory of justice in the libertarian tradition, one of Spooner's greatest achievements was &quot;to demolish the tacit consent doctrine, particularly as it applied to the U.S. Constitution.  Spooner's natural rights theory, combined with his refusal to recognize the surrender of rights through tacit consent, brings out the radical anarchism latent in the Lockean tradition.&quot;[131]
<br><br>
Certainly one critical element of the proprietary theory of justice was the view that one's just property titles could not be rightfully alienated without one's consent.  That is what it meant to own property or exercise dominion over one's own.  This was noted by some of the predecessors of the Levellers, as well as by the Levellers and other seventeenth century political thinkers.  Two years after Ponet's treatise appeared, Christopher Goodman published his Superior Powers in 1558, in which he embraced natural rights, &quot;declaring that men 'may lawfully claim' their liberty 'as their own possessions,' and concluding that 'if they suffer this right to be taken from them,' they are letting themselves be robbed no less than if they let their rulers remove any of their other goods.&quot;[132]  A century later, Richard Baxter, an English clergyman, reiterated the same point: &quot;Propriety is naturally antecedent to government. . . . Every man is born with propriety in his own members, and nature gives him a propriety in . . . [the] just acquisitions of his industry.  Therefore no rule can justly deprive men of their propriety, unless it be . . . by their own consent. . . . And men's lives and liberties are the chief parts of their propriety.&quot;[133]  The radicalism of consent doctrine was twin-edged.  No one could be obliged to obey a government to which he or she did not consent; but even more significantly, no one could be bound to contribute their &quot;lives&quot; or &quot;properties&quot; to such a government either.  The necessity of having voluntary consent to taxation or conscription makes government an impossibility.
<br><br>
Radical political philosophy since the seventeenth century has been characterized to a large extent by these forms of &quot;voluntaryism,&quot; &quot;by an emphasis on the assent of individuals as the standard of political legitimacy&quot;[134]  This review of consent theory in the libertarian tradition has sought to demonstrate that the individualist and voluntaryist character of the consent doctrine would actually &quot;deprive every existing polity of its legitimacy.&quot;[135]  Its most perceptive critics, such as Sir Robert Filmer and Josiah Tucker, clearly saw this, and their critiques of consent theory were largely premised on this realization.  Both Filmer and Tucker believed that the supporters of consent were &quot;either internally inconsistent or disastrous in their prospective practical implications.  Either their positions must be instances of remarkable stupidity or they must be held in bad faith.  If they mean what they say, their beliefs would imply anarchy.&quot;[136]  They charged their opponents &quot;with either evading the question or adopting theories that logically destroyed the moral authority of government. . . .&quot;[137]  Other others who embraced Lockean ideas were often not aware of the ultimate implications that could be deduced from their initial premises.  There is no question but that &quot;consent implies voluntariness and the association of almost every individual with the government which has control over him is clearly involuntary.&quot;[l38]  So for nearly three centuries now, the most perceptive political theorists have perceived that there is a large, unbridgeable chasm between the idea of consent and government.  There is simply no way to cross that bridge, for inevitably to contend that government rests on consent is to begin the descent on the slippery slope to anarchism.&quot;[139]
