I was raised in a conservative home, in a conservative town, with some
libertarian leanings. I grew up thinking the good old U.S. of A. was the
land of the free and the home of the brave, and that "our" Constitution
made us fundamentally different from every other country. I was a big
proponent of "limited government"--meaning police and military, and not
much else.
  <br><br>
     Back then I considered myself quite adept at explaining and arguing why
collectivism and communism are immoral and irrational, and why
"government" should have only a very limited role in "society." Since
almost everyone was more pro-"government" than I was, I was almost always
arguing AGAINST "government" doing this or that. I had little practice in
rationally justifying "government" doing what I DID want it to do.
  <br><br>
     But there was a problem. My arguments for why "government" should NOT be
taking care of the poor, controlling education, running the health care
system, and so on, applied equally well to the things I thought
"government" SHOULD be doing. For example, if individual liberty was the
moral and practical choice when it came to food production, why was it not
the moral and practical choice when it came to protection and defense? If
a welfare state forcibly robbing people in the name of fighting poverty
was immoral and counter-productive, why was forcibly robbing people in the
name of protecting them from thieves and invaders any better? Arguing
"it's for your own good," or "it's necessary," or "the collective need
justifies it," made me sound exactly like the communists I routinely
railed against. And saying "The Constitution says so" was a complete
cop-out, as if my philosophical position didn't need a rational basis as
long as it matched what a sacred piece of paper said.
  <br><br>
     I've enjoyed arguing for as long as I can remember. And whenever one
engages in intellectual battle, the chinks in his armor will always be his
OWN inconsistencies. I had made a hobby out of aiming for the giant holes
of inconsistency in the "armor" of collectivist ideas (socialism,
communism, democracy, etc.). And I wanted my own philosophical armor to be
invincible. To put it another way, because I considered THE TRUTH to be
what matters above all, and because the truth can't be inconsistent with
itself, I wanted to make sure there were no contradictions or
inconsistencies in my own belief system, and in what I was advocating. So
I spent lots of time looking at my own philosophical "armor," and saw that
it had some gaping holes in it--in other words, I saw that my philosophy
CONTRADICTED ITSELF. And that wasn't okay with me.
  <br><br>
     So I set out to remove those inconsistencies, no matter what. If my
reverence for the Constitution got in the way of being principled and
philosophically consistent, then the Constitution had to go. If "limited
government" didn't fit with a coherent, rational, consistent set of
principles, then it had to go, too. In short, I had to back up, past all
of the "civics" stuff we were all taught, and start from scratch. What I
found was very freeing, and very disturbing. I found that the entire
mythology about "government," "authority" and "law" was nonsensical
garbage. Despite the fact that the mythology was being repeated just about
everywhere, by just about everybody, it made no sense at all, for a dozen
different reasons.
  <br><br>
     I should mention that a lot of this examination and reconsidering was the
result of my wife and me throwing ideas at each other. She's another one of
those wacky people who want to know the truth--whatever it is--and who
don't want to believe in lies and contradictions. Having both been
"limited government" believers, over time we basically "corrupted" each
other into becoming anarchists, eventually giving up the mythology of
"government" entirely. (Don't talk or think too much, or the same thing
might happen to you!)
  <br><br>
     Now, most of the anarchists I know gave up statism because they decided
that, as a practical matter, a completely free society would work better
than any "government"-controlled society, and that "government" is not
really necessary. But I arrived at anarchism/voluntaryism by a different
route: I figured out, via simple logic, that "government" is impossible. I
don't mean that GOOD "government" is impossible (though it is); I mean
that the entire concept of "government" is a self-contradictory myth.
There's no such thing, and can be no such thing. There can NEVER be a
legitimate ruling class, so arguing about WHAT KIND of ruling class we
should have, or what it should do, was a completely pointless discussion.
If "government" isn't real, debating what it should be like is silly.
  <br><br>
     Of course, the gang of mercenaries is very real, as are the politicians,
but it is the supposed LEGITIMACY of their rule that makes them
"government," and makes their commands "law," and makes disobedience to
such commands "crime," and so on. Without the RIGHT to do what they
do--without the moral right to rule--the gang ceases to be "government,"
and becomes organized crime.
  <br><br>
     By trying to reconcile contradictions in my own political beliefs, I
proved to myself that "government" can NEVER be legitimate. It can never
have "authority." However necessary it supposedly is, and however noble
the stated goal might be, I eventually realized that it is utterly
impossible for anyone to acquire the right to rule others, even in a
limited, "constitutional" way.
  <br><br>
     There are several ways to prove this, and each of them is astonishingly
simple. For example, if a person cannot delegate a right he doesn't have,
then it is impossible for those in "government" to have any rights that I
do not personally have. (Where and how would they have acquired such
super-human rights?) Furthermore, unless human beings can actually ALTER
morality by mere decree, then all "legislation" is pointless and
illegitimate. If one accepts the principle of non-aggression, then
"government" is logically impossible, because a "government" without the
right to tax, regulate, or legislate (which are all threats of aggression)
is no "government" at all. And just as no one can have the right to rule
me, I can never have any obligation to obey anyone's command over my own
"conscience," which rules out any possibility of any outside "authority."
  <br><br>
     In short, I came to the conclusion that "government" is one big lie. It is
a mythical, super-human deity which people hope will save them from
reality. It is a superstition no more rational than the belief in Santa
Claus, and infinitely more destructive. "Anarchy," meaning a lack of
"government," isn't just what SHOULD be; it is what is, and what has
always been. And by hallucinating an "authority" and a "government" that
is not there, human beings have created an incomprehensible level of
violence and oppression, covering the earth and stretching back to the
beginning of recorded history.
 <br><br>
     So now I spend much of my time trying to persuade others to give up the
cult of statism. I do not advocate abolishing "government" any more than I
advocate abolishing Santa Claus. I just want people to stop letting their
perceptions and actions be so profoundly warped and perverted by something
that DOES NOT EXIST, and never did. That is why I refer to the belief in
"government" and "authority" as "The Most Dangerous Superstition." If
people could give up that superstition, even if they did not otherwise
become any more wise or compassionate, the state of society would
drastically improve. I don't pretend to have the ability to make anyone
more virtuous, but by pointing out to them the contradictions in their own
belief systems--the very same contradictions I struggled with for years--I
hope to help some of them reclaim ownership of themselves, so they can
start thinking and acting as rational, sentient beings, instead of as the
well-trained livestock of malicious masters.
