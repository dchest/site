I am 31 years old with a wife, 3-year-old son, and 1-year-old daughter. I am a
Massage Therapist, Acupuncturist, and Chinese Herbalist. I write mostly on the
topics of Voluntaryism, Agorism, Precious Metals, Anarcho-Capitalism, Austrian
Macroeconomics, Statism, The Federal Reserve, Libertarianism etc.
<br/><br/>

I never considered myself a true Anarcho-Capitalist or simply put, an Anarchist
until quite recently. I have studied quite in depth the whole freedom
philosophy, Libertarianism, and Precious Metals but I never, until very
recently, made the leap from thinking "Central Banks and Governments have
caused the vast majority of the problems in the world." to "We, as a
society, do not need the State or a Central Bank or any governing body of
overlords for that matter to maintain control over us in the same manner that a
slave does not need his slave master to periodically whip and beat him into
submission." Now looking back on my transformation the process seems
entirely natural and inevitable.
<br/><br/>

I come from a fiercely Democratic family on my mother’s side. Growing up I recall
many family reunions with the adults having heated discussions on politics,
healthcare, education, foreign policy, taxation, government etc. I never really
displayed an interest as it seemed both complex and irrelevant to my life. My
mother has always been the guiding force in my life, encouraging me to dig
deeper and question things when necessary, always within the framework of the
system of course. As I proceeded through my government schooling I first
started thinking differently when, at the urging of a fellow budding
revolutionary trapped in the system, I read “Hyperspace” by Michio Kaku in 7th grade. This marked the beginning of my intellectual transformation at 12 years old when I started reading and learning extensively in the fields of chess, piano,
theoretical physics, astronomy, cosmology, Eastern/Western philosophy, holistic
nutrition, holistic medicine etc. In 9th grade I started my own
chess club which was in effect until I graduated from my government
indoctrination, after which it was disbanded due to lack of cohesive interest.
My contrarian views irritated many of my teachers, although admittedly a select
few of them did support my efforts to look beyond the accepted genres.
<br/><br/>
One instance stands out in my mind as a teacher who found particular objection to
my stated views. She was my 12th grade Bio-Ethics teacher, who
at the beginning of the class encouraged everyone to engage in debate and conversation regarding the various topics presented. However it quickly became clear that my opinion either in out spoken debate or written on paper assignments was not appreciated by her. She found it necessary to give me a stern talking to as to how I should comport myself in the debates and how I should write in my
assignments. Thereafter, no exaggeration, I spoke and wrote as simply as a 1st grader and she duly rewarded me for my lack of effort with grades in the 90s as opposed to previous grades in the 60s and 70s.
<br/><br/>
Throughout high school and college I would write my thoughts down in various places. However certain lengthy papers, outside of my schooling, are of particular note including my “Eternal Testament”, “Naturalist Theory”, “Soul of History”, and
“TCM Oriental Nutrition-Philosophy”. These comprise the bulk of my most
essential writings and thoughts. My intellectual and philosophical evolution is
most evident in my writings.
<br/><br/>
After graduating my college in 2005 with a Master’s degree in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine I continued my independent studies of Chinese Medicine, Eastern Nutrition, and Holistic healing from books and online sources. The information I derived from these venues proved to be much more valuable than anything I could have learned in college. From there I started an informal newsletter I would send out to family and friends regarding the politics of health and nutrition. This is where my real adventure began
<br/><br/>

My real introduction to alternative views of the economy, government, and politics
started with the “Zeitgeist” trilogy and then with “Thrive: What On Earth Will
It Take?” From there my reading of “The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second
Look at the Federal Reserve” catapulted my understanding of economics to new
heights, from which it has never regained its original statist dimensions. In
August 2012, I began my silver first purchases and dove head first into the
realm of Libertarianism and Anarcho-Capitalism with my reading of Murray
Rothbard, Henry Hazlitt, Frederick Hayek, Walter Block, Mike Maloney etc. and I
haven’t looked back since. Thereafter I was exposed to Voluntary Anarchy through
Jeff Berwick from Dollar Vigilante, Amanda BillyRock, Larken Rose, and that led
me, most naturally to, voluntaryist.com.
<br/><br/>
It has been a wonderful journey for me that has certainly produced my fair share
of spousal and familial arguments, which has not deterred my fascination in the
least. Rather my inadequacy in explaining some of the magnificent and logical
concepts of a truly voluntary society has only fueled my desire to further
educate myself in this most complex realm. I constantly endeavor to explain to
the most ardent statists the nature of their self-imposed State subsidized cage
we are all living in and how it simply collapses without our consent and
participation. It may be that some have come to cherish and love their shackles
to the point of vicious defense. They are free to live in this way so long as
they understand the phantasmagoria that comprises their servitude.

<br/><br/>

The principles of Non-aggression, individual sovereign rights, and voluntary
exchange are the methods most sane people, friends or those in the market place, use
to interact with each other on a daily basis. Why should these principles be
inapplicable when a few sociopaths don expensive suits, surround themselves
with elaborate ceremonies, and call themselves government? Why are we expected
to abandon all semblance of reason and logic when we hear their hypocrital
words spasmodically spew forth from their mouths with all the abundance of an
erupting Mount Vesuvius? Why do slaves reflexively ostracize other slaves who
opt to ascend by peacefully choosing to reject the accepted rites of our
enslavement?
<br/><br/>

people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the
oppressing.”</strong> Malcolm X

I want to leave a peaceful and voluntary world for my kids to partake in when
they come of age. Therefore I will utilize all the power of my words and of
non-violent action to achieve those ends. I steadfastly believe this can be
achieved non-violently and peacefully. No violent revolution, coup, or
assassination is needed. All we need to do to defeat the State is to stop
acknowledging its existence through our taxation, voting, attention, and
participation. By this method it will most assuredly shrivel up and die, for no
parasite can subsist without a willing supply of nourishment by its host.
