Of course, I didn't know it at the time. Nor did I
clearly understand the premise behind my behavior.
Nevertheless my heart was ablaze and my bones were
on fire. Even the icy wind was unnoticed as I entered
the Federal courthouse that February morning in the
early 1960s. I had no lawyer. I had been fighting for
six long years and this was the final showdown.
Would I be sent to prison for the next five years of
my young life?<br/><br/>
As the Federal judge spoke, I stood quietly in luminous
rays of sunlight flowing through the windows.
Looking upwards towards the bench of justice, I gazed
at the motes of dust floating on the shafts of light.
While at times you can be made to feel as insignificant
as a microscopic dust mote, you are still empowered;
you can say 'No,' even if that's all you can
do. Sensing he didn't seem to have my full attention,
the judge attempted to sound as if he were giving a
pronouncement of one of the Ten Commandments.
"Thou shalt not resist induction into the United
States military!"<br/><br/>
Well, at least that's the impression he was trying
to convey. What he did say was, "I've sent many a
person like you to prison, and you wouldn't be the
last! Do you have anything to say for yourself?" I offered
my hands as if bound by the court. "You may be
able to bind me, you may be able to confine me, you
may be able to burn me with fire, you may be able to
drown me in water or blood. You may be able to hack
me to pieces and feed me to the lions, but coercion
can never buy my compliance! Just what part of'No'
do you have a difficulty understanding?"<br/><br/>
Oddly, the courtroom audience cheered. The judge
slammed the gavel repeatedly like a nasty child
throwing a temper tantrum. "One more outburst like
that and I'll clear this courtroom!" Looking now even
less friendly he glared at me and stated, "I'm not on
trial here, you are!" Figuring I was already going to
prison and that my last words would earn me an
additional contempt charge, I knew I must speak out.
The words came out of my mouth like football players
from a locker room at the Superbowl. "No! Your
Honor, you are on trial in a higher court. Your integrity
is on trial! Your honesty is on trial! Your fairness
is on trial! You as a human being will be judged this
day no matter what happens to me. I am unrepentant
in resisting the draft. Now you must be unbiased
when you judge my honesty."<br/><br/>
The judge called for a short recess. When he returned,
his countenance appeared changed. This time
he spoke softly. "I can't agree with your position. However,
I do agree that you deserve a re-classification
as a conscientious objector. You are free to go."<br/><br/>
As I said to start with, I didn't clearly see the
premise. The underlying foundation is that every act,
every decision is voluntary. No one can force another
person into slavery or servitude unless that person
chooses to be a slave or servant. Likewise freedom is
voluntary as well. No one can force you to change
your mind or relinquish a position unless you volunteer
to do so. Neither steel bars nor iron chains can
imprison your mind. Only you can do that by failing
to reason and by failing to listen to the dictates of
your own heart and conscience.<br/><br/>
So am I a voluntaryist? I wasn't then, but I am
now because I realize that my presence in court many
decades ago was voluntary. Even had I been been
ordered to report for induction, I would have refused
rather than endure the pain of violating my own conscience.
I became a voluntaryist the day I fully realized
no one could force me to do anything I did not
want to do. I became a voluntaryist the day I fully
realized I am responsible for the consequences of any
decision I make. I became a voluntaryist the day I
realized I was self-owned: that I own myself; that I
own my mind; that I own my life.<br/><br/>
When Alexander the Great was about to cross the
Ganges River in India, he met an old sage. As
Alexander questioned the sage about what he was to
expect when he crossed the river with his army, the
sage's answer shocked him. It is said the old man
looked Alexander straight in the eye and replied,
"You'll never be able to conquer them." "What! I'm
Alexander the Great! I've got the power of the world's
greatest army behind me. Do you realize this very
moment I have the power to cut your head off? Then
what would you do?" Unflinchingly the old man said,
"Well, then I suppose we would both watch it fall,
wouldn't we?" Alexander, changing his tone, asked
"So why is it you believe those people can't be conquered?"
The wise man, looking Alexander through,
retorted, "Because they don't love money and they
don't fear death!" It is said that at that point
Alexander the Great turned his armies around. Of
course, I might have added, "And what is it about
'No' that you don't understand?"<br/><br/>
Physical freedom can be curtailed by force but coercion
can never buy willing acquiescence. No victory
requires the use of power and force. The only
victories ever won are in the hearts and minds of
individuals. All power, contrary to common consensus,
lies in the individual's voluntary 'Yes' or 'No.'
You can chop people's fingers off so they cannot write.
Then you will have to cut their tongues out of their
mouths so they cannot speak. But ultimately you will
have to cauterize their brains so they cannot think.
At that point you will have to find and extinguish
their spirit so they cannot exist. And what will you
have won?<br/><br/>
Pyrrhic victories are never victories at all. What
cost is to be paid to silence another? It was while
reading Carl Watner's collection of essays, I MUST
SPEAK OUT, that I became duly impressed with the
profound concept of voluntary behavior. I might be
killed but I can never be forced against my will. It is
only fools and politicians who attempt to live their
lives by controlling others. Everything we do is voluntary
no matter what the cost. The only question
remaining is, where to draw the line in the sand?
And only reason and conscience can dictate that.<br/><br/>
How far can one be pushed, how many cherished
beliefs trampled upon, how many values assaulted,
before the steel in one's spine stiffens? I don't know.
Everyone is different. One day, that skinny-armed
boy becomes a man with bulging biceps due to the
resistance he finds in the gym. One day also comes
when that young man forges and builds his philosophical
edifice as his ideas, beliefs and values are
tested. Testing and resistance are food for developing
noble characters and the stalwart qualities that
we admire in heroic men and women. Like iron filings
are attracted to a magnet, men and women of
purpose are drawn to high ideals. So, most naturally
I was drawn to the work of Carl Watner. It is often a
matter of integrity to speak out, which I did in that
courtroom four decades ago. You probably now understand
that as a voluntaryist, I, too, must speak
out, as will some day millions of others. <br/>
"This above all&mdash;to thine own self be true, <br/>
And it must follow, as the night the day, <br/>
Thou canst not then be false to any man."</font> <br></p>
