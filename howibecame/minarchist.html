            By Steve Patterson<br/><br/></center>
            <em>[Editor's Note: Although the author does not describe himself as a voluntaryist in this article, in latter correspondence with me he related that he was "equally comfortable identifying himself as a voluntaryist  as I am a market anarchist." His evolution from constitutional, limited government statist to free-market anarchist  points to the many diverse ways people are turned onto voluntaryism.]</em><br/><br/>
Four years ago, I became an anarchist, and I’ve never looked back. My
political philosophy now runs through my veins. But this wasn’t always
the case. I used to be a young, apathetic conservative. Then, I was
introduced to libertarianism, which slowly turned me into an anarchist.
This might sound crazy, but I assure you, it’s quite reasonable, and
many people share my same story.
<br/><br/>
It all started in 2007. I was casually aware of politics at the time. My
parents were conservative, so I was conservative. YouTube was still
relatively new, and I remember one day stumbling across a video of Ron
Paul <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XGKpYaIl0M>. I was immediately
intrigued. Here was this funny old man saying the opposite of his fellow
Republicans on stage, and he called himself a “Constitutional
conservative”. This sounded appealing. He would say all these
fascinating things I’d never heard before, and the more videos I
watched, the more excited I became. After only a few weeks, I was fully
on-board with the platform of this Ron Paul guy. Little did I know this
resonance with a political philosophy would change my life.
<br/><br/>
If you know anything about Ron Paul, you know he’s an exception to the
rule. He was a politician, yes, but only in title. Politicians are
(rightly) known as slimy, spineless, unprincipled folk whose political
ambition overrules any shred of integrity they possess. Ron is the
opposite. He defies the oxymoron “principled politician”. He’s been
called the one exception to the gang of 535. And it shows when he talks.
He doesn’t appeal to rhetorical flourishes or woo the crowd with empty
platitudes. He really believes what he says and speaks out of
conviction, something nonexistent among politicians.
<br/><br/>
But to me, ultimately, Ron Paul is a charming, principled nerd. He’s an
extremely well-educated man in every area of political thought,
especially Economics. He puts philosophic ideas above politics or
elections. In fact, he used his presidential campaigns as educational
platforms. Ron didn’t think he could win, but he knew more people would
discover the power of free-market ideas if he ran for president.
<br/><br/>
But as he would tell you, Ron Paul’s ideas are more important than his
person. Millions of people were swayed by the philosophy of freedom, not
just his charming personality. The core principles of limited government
resonated through all political upbringings, whether you identified as a
liberal, conservative, or were apathetic.
<br/><br/>
Given my conservative ideology, I knew that lots of people gave lip
service to the Constitution, but rarely did they defend it consistently.
They supported military intervention overseas, but balked at the idea of
requiring Congress to formally declare war. They complained about the
Department of Education, but would only support gentle budget cuts, at
most. Ron said what conservatives were too afraid to say: get the
government out of education altogether. We don’t need a 10% budget
reduction; we need to abolish the whole department! Conservatives say
they support individual responsibility and don’t want a nanny-state.
Then how can they support the War on Drugs? If an adult decides to
peacefully smoke pot in his basement, and not hurt anybody, we don’t
need a nanny-state micro-manage his life and throw him in jail.
Conservatives supposedly want you to be free to make bad decisions, as
long as you pay the consequences for them.
<br/><br/>
Probably the most controversial position Ron held was on the US
military. He thought, as old-school conservatives did, that we should be
extremely cautious before intervening in foreign affairs. He also
thought the Pentagon wasn’t infallible; they are prone to the same
egregious waste and mismanagement as the Department of Education. This
ruffled a lot of feathers. It shouldn’t have. Ron simply applied the
same principles across the whole spectrum of government.
<br/><br/>
He was consistent, and he kept coming back to the following principle:
what is the proper role of government? Before we argue about cutting 10%
of the Department of Education’s budget, shouldn’t we discuss whether or
not it should exist in the first place? Is it appropriate, or even
Constitutional, for the Executive Branch to send troops into foreign
counties for an extended amount of time without Congressional
declaration? Before we nibble around the edges of government spending,
we need to talk about what government should do in the first place.
<br/><br/>
To me, he was precisely correct, but it revealed an unsavory truth:
Republicans and Democrats aren’t so different from each other. One party
might want to raise spending 5%; the other might want to cut spending
5%, but both favor the status quo and support big government in their
respective areas. Liberals and conservatives are like two sides of the
same coin. Constitutional conservatism, I thought, represented a real
alternative.
<br/><br/>
But my journey didn’t stop there, because Ron implanted a little seed in
my head. When he spoke, he often mentioned the “Austrian School of
Economics”. I never heard of it, but eventually, I decided to Google
around. What I discovered changed my life. I came across the Mises
Institute <http://mises.org/>, which had a number of free books and
lectures online about Austrian Economics. I was immediately enamored.
The explanatory power of Economics was breathtaking. After diving into
the literature, I didn’t simply believe government was inefficient,
I understood why. This had an enormous impact on my political
philosophy, and it started my transition to radical libertarianism.
<br/><br/>
I now believe it’s impossible to have a clear understanding about how
the world works without Economics. The coordination of prices, profits,
and losses in a market is awe-inspiring. No exaggeration – it is almost
miraculous. I will write extensively about this at a later time. But
suffice to say, Economics became a pillar around which I would develop
my other political beliefs.
<br/><br/>
The further I learned – the further I went down the rabbit hole of
Austrian Economics – the more “radical” I became. Not only was
government inefficient at delivering mail, but they were inefficient
everywhere they intervened. The same economic principles apply to the
Post Office as apply to the Patent Office. Of course, this wasn’t
radicalism for the sake of radicalism, it was just consistency. And if
you apply economic principles consistently across the board, you are
left with a very grim perspective of government. However, I was no
anarchist.
<br/><br/>
I firmly believed in small-government libertarianism. Markets could
handle everything except few core services: the courts, military, and
police. Of course, this would be considered wildly limited government
compared to today’s standards.
<br/><br/>
My first interaction with an anarchist, ironically enough, was as an
intern in Ron Paul’s congressional office. I was given the opportunity
to be his intern in DC for a semester, and one of his staffers
considered himself an anarchist. He was a nice guy, but I didn’t take
his ideas too seriously.
<br/><br/>
But that changed in the summer of 2010. I was fortunate enough to attend
a conference for students at the Mises Institute – the organization I
held in such high regard. The conference was called “Mises University”,
and it would be a week long, focusing solely on Austrian Economics. I
was elated, and it turned out to be one of the most intellectually
stimulating weeks of my life. I was surrounded with the smartest peers
I’ve ever met.
<br/><br/>
A few lectures hinted at the possibility of complete statelessness – the
idea that private entrepreneurs could better provide all the services of
government, including courts, military, and police. Supposedly, for the
same reasons we don’t want government to monopolize the production of
shoes, we don’t want them to monopolize the court system or the
production of national defense. I wasn’t convinced.
<br/><br/>
During the middle of the week, I was forced to adjust my beliefs a
little bit, so I called myself a “Secessionist” for a few days. But I
was no anarchist. I agreed with some core ideas – that taxation is
fundamentally coercive and is therefore theft. I agreed that markets
were based on voluntary, peaceful human interaction, while governments
were necessarily based on violence or threats of violence; and I agreed
that, in a perfect world, we wouldn’t need any coercion whatsoever –
voluntary decisions would reign supreme. But, I thought, we don’t live
in a perfect world, and surely in some circumstances, large groups of
people wouldn’t care about the “rights” of an individual. Statelessness
might sound nice in theory, but in practice, people wouldn’t respect the
property rights of a lone anarchist, declaring his independence in the
middle of a city.
<br/><br/>
Until one night, when I was challenged by a fellow student named Dan. He
was a pretty burly guy, former Air Force I think, and we were hanging
out at one of the local bars after the lectures. (Of course, “hanging
out at the bar” at Mises University really meant “talking loudly about
nerdy ideas in public places”. I remember some locals dancing at the
bar, but they were outnumbered 3-1 by sweaty geeks talking about
monetary history.)
<br/><br/>
I told Dan about my hesitations with anarchism, and he said he
understood. “But,” he said, “let me ask you this: if I want to opt out
of government services, should I be able to?” It’s a simple question,
but I didn’t know how to respond. I wanted to say, “Of course you should
be able to opt out of government services! If you don’t want to pay, you
don’t have to, but then you don’t get to use the services.” But alas,
such an admission would be tantamount to anarchism. After all,
government services are by definition tied to taxation, and you can’t
opt out of taxation. Doing so would be opting out of government, which
is precisely what these anarchists were talking about.
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, I couldn’t say with a straight face that indeed, Dan
should never be able to opt out of government services. I’d have to be
willing to put him in jail if he tried. Even if his decision to opt out
was poor – if he’d be better off by using the services – I couldn’t
justify forcing him to pay for something he didn’t want. So, I was
perplexed. I didn’t have a good response, and I remember slowly
responding, “I think I might be an anarchist now.”
<br/><br/>
I wrestled with that question for the next few months, as I kept trying
to justify the existence of involuntary government. I read a book called
Chaos Theory
<http://library.mises.org/books/Robert%20P%20Murphy/Chaos%20Theory.pdf> by
Bob Murphy, which has a section on the private production of law. My
list of necessary government services dwindled. Then it happened: I
became a closet anarchist. After playing devil’s advocate so much with
myself – being an annoying anarchist – I couldn’t find a proper
counter-argument to my critiques of limited government.
<br/><br/>
I was shocked. I couldn’t believe I’d ended up so far away from where I
started. I thought anarchists were bomb-throwing hooligans who smashed
in windows for recreation. But this type of anarchism was about private
property and peaceful, voluntary cooperation. I saw the contradictions
and inconsistencies in popular conservatism, and I couldn’t stomach it
any longer.
<br/><br/>
By the end of 2010, I came out of the closet. But I didn’t know what to
call myself. “Anarchist” seemed too dramatic and hot-button. (Believe it
or not, people dismiss you rather quickly upon identifying as an
anarchist.) I toyed around with labels like “anti-statist” or other
nonsense, but I’ve recently settled on the term I find most appropriate:
market anarchism.
<br/><br/>
You can sum up market anarchism succinctly: all the services which are
currently provided by governments can be more efficiently and ethically
provided by private entrepreneurs. Granted, there’s a million different
ways to phrase it, but that’s how I prefer. Really not so radical, is it?
<br/><br/>
Four years later, and my conviction has become stronger. The explanatory
power of market anarchism is unparalleled. Politics finally makes sense
when you throw out the romance surrounding government and patriotism.
But what’s surprising to me is how my own justification for anarchism
has changed. I still wholly subscribe to Austrian Economic theory, but
now I am even more compelled by the ethical and philosophic arguments
for anarchism. To an anarchist, it’s clear as day: taxation is theft.
Theft is immoral. Therefore, taxation is immoral, which condemns
government as immoral. Simple and profound.
<br/><br/>
Upon taking the leap to anarchism, it appears preposterous and naive to
try and manage the lives of a hundred million people from a central
planning board. Social problems involving 300 million people aren’t
resolvable by one tiny group forcing everybody to act a certain way,
threatening them with jail time if they don’t comply. It seems clear.
<br/><br/>
On a philosophic level, proponents for government run into trouble: what
exactly is a government, anyway? Upon inspection, “governments” are only
grandiose, harmful abstractions; they have no tangible reality. We live
in a world inhabited by humans – not “governments” or “countries”. This
might sound absurd – and I won’t defend the claims right now – but I
intend to give rigorous explanations for these ideas in the future.
<br/><br/>
The anarchist worldview is radically individualist, not because it views
people as isolated decision-makers, but because individualism is the
most philosophically critical way of viewing the world. It helps us
avoid dramatic abstractions and opens up the world of economic thinking.
And at this point, I can’t imagine turning back; anarchism has gone to
my core.
<br/><br/>
If anybody is intrigued by this story, I only ask they pursue the topic
sincerely. Hold on to your objections as long as you can, and see if
your beliefs can withstand the criticism of market anarchist arguments.
I humbly suggest starting with Austrian Economics and see where it
leads. I, for one, sought political truths as a young conservative, and
I believe I’ve found them in market anarchism.
