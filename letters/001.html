<p>Dear Editor:</p>

<p>I am a newcomer to the Voluntaryist audience after having recently discovered
your website.&nbsp; It was a great joy to find it, because the voluntaryist philosophy
your publication espouses is certainly the closest to my own.&nbsp; Plus, it is
always a relief to find others who agree with you, that you are not entirely isolated.</p>

<p>This relief is all the greater, because I have increasingly felt that other libertarian
and radical free-market sites were failing the cause of liberty.&nbsp; I will
refrain from naming names, but the leading outlets for such ideas, in my opinion,
are generally unwilling to draw out all of the implications of their philosophical
conclusions.</p>

<p>For example, they believe in the sovereignty of the individual in some fashion,
but refuse to consider the political principles that we would have to then assume.&nbsp;
Instead, they confine themselves to economic considerations and pontificate on
rather abstract economic analyses in isolation from broader cultural and political
questions.</p>

<p>Related to this failure to draw their principles to their logical conclusions,
they never advocate initiating any action.&nbsp; Well, perhaps in some roundabout
way they do.&nbsp; For example, they recommend home-schooling or make vague allusions
to what they may do with their guns in some remote future, perhaps when things
get &quot;really&quot; bad.&nbsp; I do not mean to disparage home-schooling at
all or to advocate violent revolution (far from it), merely to point out the limited
fashion with which they are willing to consider the questions before them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most popular site still engages in debates about whether or not to
vote Republican, only occasionally on whether or not they should vote at all.&nbsp;
The legitimacy of the current government is questioned rarely, if ever.&nbsp;
At best, they advocate a return to pristine constitutionalism.&nbsp; Considering
all the evils they attach to government, especially the current one, their lack
of interest in&nbsp;real&nbsp;political action or political thought is perplexing
and, ultimately, demoralizing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Another popular&nbsp;site, perhaps more radical, takes a more active stance on
these questions and tends towards &quot;anarcho-capitalism,&quot;&nbsp;but the
price it pays for its radicalism is to adopt an excessively propagandistic and
alarmist tone.&nbsp; It tries to depict the current system as one already given
over to the worst attributes of the police state, while failing to address the
more dangerous, if more subtle, characteristics explored by your site.</p>

<p>This is the only reasonable and articulate site I have found that advocates &quot;attacking&quot;
government, i.e. by withdrawing one's consent from it.&nbsp; The rest are apparently
committed to nurturing a sense of alarm and resentment without any means of redress.&nbsp;
I applaud your site for this.&nbsp; Although I am not entirely sure that civilization
is quite ready to completely abolish the state (I still have some hope that there
is something like a consensual state), I am encouraged by your insistence upon
the principles of consent (supposedly this is a principle universally accepted
in democracies) and&nbsp;of non-violent change.</p>

<p>Why these two&nbsp;ideas&nbsp;are not&nbsp;embraced&nbsp;by the entire libertarian
world is an utter mystery to me, and I hope the Voluntaryist is successful in
solving it.</p>

<p>Regards,<br>
