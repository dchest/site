<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hello Carl, </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Thanks
very much for adding me to the voluntaryist email group. I actually
found your site a few months back. I have been working my way through
&quot;I MUST SPEAK OUT&quot; and am enjoying it immensely. I can&#39;t remember
exactly how I found the Voluntaryist, but I do remember that the first
article I read was Wendy McElroy&#39;s &quot;Why I Would Not Vote Against
Hitler.&quot; I must have followed a link. At the time, that essay shocked
me. But I also could not refute its logic or moral consistency. It encouraged
me to read on. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     I
am coming to you as fallout from the Ron Paul presidential campaign.
I was apolitical for most of my life. But like a lot of people, I felt
a certain civic duty to educate myself and participate in the last election.
In short, that was the beginning of some serious study and soul-searching.
I didn&#39;t anticipate where it would take me, but I had to be honest with
myself as I realized that political parties contradict their own messages
and use immoral methods to achieve self-serving ends. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     It
took me some time to get here, but once I did, voluntaryism resonated
with me instantly because it is aligned with my own natural moral compass.
I have always struggled with collectivist ideology. I have never had
any interest in dictating how someone else should live his or her life.
Likewise, I have never felt entitled to anything that belonged to someone
else - I just want the opportunity to work peacefully and keep the fruits
of my labor. To me, these things seemed at once self-evident but also
completely foreign to modern society. Although I didn&#39;t realize it at
the time, I think that my frustration with politics resulted from my
subconscious understanding that true freedom cannot come from political
institutions and is, in fact, not even the goal of those institutions. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     I&#39;m
very grateful for your work on the Voluntaryist. As I discuss the things
that I am learning with my friends and family, I am being confronted
with fear, ignorance and, at times, scorn. It makes me appreciate, all
the more, the work that you do in what feels like an uphill battle most
of the time. Your writing has brought me comfort and inspiration and
enlightenment. It is evidence that you don&#39;t always know when and how
your work will bear fruit. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Thanks
very much for your diligence and bravery! </font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">                              <WBR>                              <WBR>                              <WBR>
Best wishes,</font></p>
