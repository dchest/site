<p>Dear Editor:</p>

                          Letter to the Editor

     "Grant No Man the Authority to Make You His Slave" by Peter Ragnar (Whole Number 127) was very interesting: "When asked how one could be a free man and yet a slave, the ancient Athenian slave, Diogenes, answered, 'Simply, by the number of times you say master.'" <br><br>
     To put it in modern terms, you say "master" every time you
<br>1) go to the store and pay the sales tax after you buy food, fuel, or supplies;
<br>2) carry a Driver's License;
<br>3) use or refer to your Social Security number (like when you open a bank account or receive a paycheck from your employer with Social Security deductions);
<br>4) drive a car with a license plate issue by your master;
<br>5) flush the toilet and accept the master's processing of your wastes;
<br>6) use electricity that is provided by a master's-owned generating plant;
<br>7) take medicine that has been approved by the master (FDA);
<br>8) send your children to a state-run kindergarten/school/university;
<br>9) send a letter via the United States Postal Service;
<br>10) use the "licensed" services of a physician, real-estate agent, broadcaster, telephone, insurance agent, day-care, or taxi;
<br>11) when you tender or accept Federal Reserve notes issued by the master.
     <br><br>This is the short list, of course, I hope our author, Peter Ragnar, would tell us how Diogenes would reply to his masters if he were in our situation.<br><br>
                                                             - Anonymous
