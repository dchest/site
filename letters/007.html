 TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE
<br><br>
 I am no fan of government.   Common sense practically shouts that
 without its vexatious presence and all its regulations, taxes, wars,
 destructive cultural manipulation and the like, the majority of us
 would be vastly better off. On the basis of this appealing logic, I
 have long classified myself as a libertarian, and have enjoyed the
 Voluntaryist and its acerbic observations of government shortcomings.
 It's nice to know that there are a few kindred spirits swimming about
 in the seething sea of human chaos. However, one can hardly contemplate
 the warts and pustules of government without confronting daunting
 questions, to wit: Why was government  invented in the first place, and
 why does it so stubbornly persist? Can it be improved?   How can it be
 that in America, blessed as it was with the revolutionary ideals of
 Paine, Franklin and Jefferson, and where oppressive government was
 expelled at so terrible a cost, the wretched organization has
 mysteriously re-appeared like the proverbial Phoenix and grown bigger
 and badder than ever? Ditto for France, whose revolutionary adventure
 was even more horrific and was succeeded by Napoleon, empire and war
 even within the living memory of Voltaire and the philosophs. Are
 government dynamics so powerful that we can never rid ourselves of its
 presence? Could it be that no matter who is chosen as a leader or how
 leaders are chosen, government  policies will remain essentially
 unchanged?   These questions lead ultimately to the most disturbing
 question of all: Is government  the product of the innate behavioral
 characteristics of man?  Is it possible that government can be neither
 eradicated nor even improved without first changing the essential
 nature of human beings? These questions are both unpleasant and
 difficult to answer, because the precise origins of government are
 obviously lost to the sands of time. They suggest that human existence
 may forever be doomed to suffer the inescapable brutalities and
 inefficiencies of government, and that sooner or later all
 civilizations must collapse beneath the weight of its destructive
 effects.   Is there no hope?  Are we libertarians little more than the
philosophical black stuff between the toes of the Hobbes Leviathan
(i.e. slow natives)?
<br><br>
 Science routinely confronts similar  mysteries of the physical world,
 including those of biology.  The scientific approach to finding answers
 to such problems involves proposing explanations of observed facts and
 then challenging them with careful observations in an effort to find
 exceptions that render them invalid. Such proposed explanations are
 called "hypotheses" and if experimental challenges fail to show them
 defective, and they are able to predict results, then they become
 accepted as "truth" by the majority of scientists and are elevated to
 the status of "theory".  However, a theory remains in good graces only
 until it fails to explain a critical observation. In the hope of
 obtaining a more accurate understanding of the origins and nature of
 government,  the better to eradicate it, or at least improve it, I
 propose a hypothesis: Human beings are animals, and government is the
 product of their innate social nature.
<br><br>
 The animal kingdom offers considerable evidence that government is not
 exclusive to humans.  Few animal species consist of individuals so
 formidable as to be immune to attack from other species, and these
 generally lead solitary lives and avoid contact with one another. Polar
 bears and orangutans offer examples, but even these have been observed
 to engage in social behavior in rare circumstances. There is strength
 in numbers, and individual survival is generally enhanced by group
 formation.  The vast majority of animal species form social hierarchies
 spontaneously and instinctively, and the forms and styles of these
 hierarchies are characteristic of animal classes. These animal
 behaviors are generally called "social behaviors". When viewed in
 perspective, it is obvious that the social behavior of animals, which
 serves both military and productive purposes, is a manifestation of
 government. We even have  names for the various types of animal
 government.    Wolves dwell in "packs".  Cats exist in "prides".
 Ungulates form "herds". Whales form "pods". Fish form "schools". Ants
 and termites live in "colonies".  Bees form "hives". Birds form
 "flocks". Each  animal family type has distinctive group-related styles
 and methods of  seeking food and shelter, breeding, fighting, and
 selecting leaders. The leaders organize their followers in a manner
 that enhances attack and defense and sustains productive activities
 necessary for survival. The process of determining leadership may be
 called "politics".  In lower forms of animals, such as insects,  this
 behavior is instinctive and genetically programmed. In higher animals,
 it often involves learned behavior including deceit, treachery, guile,
 bluffs, threats, and lethal violence, these being the tools necessary
 to gull or force lesser group members to submit to the will of the
 leader. As everyone familiar with animal husbandry knows, the
 aggressive temperament associated with such animal "social" behavior is
 largely determined by genetics and can be exaggerated or mitigated via
 selective breeding.
<br><br>
 Not surprisingly, food and sex are the primary benefits of successful
 animal leadership.  Animal leaders generally gain improved access to
 food and sexual opportunities, both of which might be expected to
 enhance their ability to transmit their genetic characteristics to
 subsequent generations.  However, the pursuit of leadership roles often
 entails an increased risk of death, for animal leaders are often
 obliged to take the lead in attack and defense activities, while less
 aggressive animals may enjoy greater longevity that enhances their
 reproductive success and helps to maintain a "balance" of dominant and
 submissive behavior within animal populations that facilitates group
 formation.
<br><br>
 Chimpanzees, the closest living relatives of humans, have a form of
 government that is called a "troupe". Their political behavior is
 documented by Fritz van der Waal in a book called "Chimpanzee Politics"
 that describes the behavior of a group of chimpanzees brought together
 in a Belgian zoo from disparate origins. The males and females formed
 semi-independent social hierarchies, with the males superficially
 dominating the females.  However, the females exhibited a form of
 "biological supremacy" similar to that which prevails in human society,
 so as to be largely free of male political  harassment. The male
 hierarchy was dominated by a political alliance between an old
 chimpanzee named "Yeroen" and a young male named "Nikkie". This
 alliance consistently dominated all other members of the troupe,
 including"Luit", the largest and strongest individual  male.  This
 elementary  "gang" alliance illustrates how politics can enable the
 weak to dominate the strong.  The politically dominant pair led various
 attempts to escape from the confines of the zoo, and provided "justice"
 for the troupe by settling conflicts among both males and females, the
 obvious motive being to enhance their political prestige and power. In
 the wild, chimp leadership has been observed to engineer highly
 organized attacks on neighboring chimpanzee troupes to expand foraging
 territory, and to organize group hunting expeditions to attack less
 intelligent monkeys to obtain food. Thus chimpanzees, which until
 recently were thought to be peaceful vegetarians, are now recognized to
 be territorial and highly formidable group predators. Near the end of
 the observation period, a zoo keeper placed Luit in the same cage with
 Nikkie and Yeroen, and before this disastrous mistake was discovered
 the next morning, Luit had been mortally wounded and his testicles
 bitten off.
<br><br>
 The fundamental form of human government is the "tribe", and the
 similarity between the social behavior of humans and chimpanzees at
 this level is striking.  Humans, like most other animals, appear to
 instinctively form dominance hierarchies (i.e. gangs and governments)
 that are primarily military in nature.  These facilitate organized
 defense as well as attack, and enhance individual survival in the face
 of a hostile world. Seen in this context, "evil", "leadership" and
 "politics" may be synonymous. So-called "evil" human behavior,
 including lying, cheating, deceit, treachery, stealing, threats and
 violence may all be manifestations of the instinctive drive to dominate
 and control, otherwise known as "leadership",  as these forms of
 behavior are essential elements of group formation and function.
<br><br>
 In the case of humans, the considerations of leadership and power
 influence nearly every aspect of life, including sexual activity,
 dress, language, and religion.  Marriage may serve as an example.  It
 is a habit promoted by government to enhance the discipline of those
 tiny savages we all know and love, to produce better soldiers.  The
 institution may be arranged as polygamy in order to facilitate
 fertility, or as monotony (monogamy) to optimize economic productivity
 by relieving the husband of the time and energy-consuming necessity of
 dealing with more than one mate. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are
 encouraged relative to one another for similar  political purposes.
 However, severe forms of monotony eventually spell doom for any
 civilization, because of the disastrous effect on fertility, as
 exemplified by our present society. The ever-changing mix of cultural
 values observed in human society are thus induced on behalf of the
 ever-changing plans and objectives of political leadership.
<br><br>
 Like two tarantulas trapped in the same box, governments cannot
 "peacefully co-exist" if located in the same neighborhood.  Sooner or
 later, one must attack the other and either destroy it, be destroyed by
 it, merge with it, or incorporate it into an empire. For leaders, the
 stakes are high, because the leadership of the losing party in war is
 typically put to death.  This principle is clearly observed in the
 behavior of human and chimpanzee governments, and even different
 sub-species of ant colonies attack one another when they occupy the
 same territory. The historical landscape is littered with the remnants
 of destroyed civilizations, such as the Indian nations of the Americas
 that existed before the arrival of Europeans or the Etruscans who once
 shared the Italian peninsula with the Romans.  At the dawn of recorded
 Western History, it was customary for the "winning side" to
 methodically murder every man, woman and child on the "losing side"
 lest they "counter-attack" at a later time. We thus have no way of
 knowing how many civilizations have been destroyed so thoroughly as to
 leave no traces of their existence. True mergers of governments, such
 the peaceful incorporation of Scotland into England (after centuries of
 horrific warfare) are uncommon, due to the vast differences in language
 and customs that are usually present.  More commonly, governments
 incorporate one another into empires, such as the Roman Empire, the
 ancient Chinese dynasties, or the Anglo-American Empire that now
 controls practically all the countries of the world. Empires flourish
 by promoting common laws and currencies that facilitate trade and
 commerce and inhibit warfare, but the warfare necessary to establish
 empires tends to slaughter the healthiest and most intelligent
 individuals only to foster circumstances where unhealthy specimens
 proliferate.
<br><br>
 Regardless of the style of government that emerges successful over
 time, the innate characteristics of human social behavior remain
 unchanged. The political struggle rages quietly at all levels of every
 society, and though it may sometimes strengthen individual families and
 business organizations, it forever tears at the bowels of civilization,
 disrupting productive human activity and threatening disorder and
 disaster.  New gangs form and flourish even within the territory
 controlled by a government.  In the name of justice and order, human
 governments employ police and courts to suppress so-called "criminal"
 activity which is an expression of the instinctive leadership paradigm,
 though it is seldom recognized as such. Unfortunately, the primary
 objective of courts and police is power and control, as opposed to
 justice, and they probably facilitate the occult objectives of
 political/criminal machination more often than suppress them. Sooner or
 later, even the most successful examples of government and civilization
 find themselves torn apart from within by the unceasing corrosive
 effects political activity, and collapse.
<br><br>
 A libertarian such as yours truly would prefer to believe that human
 beings are gifted with the ability to reason and thereby achieve a
 state of ultimate civilized behavior, peace and prosperity. The animal
 evidence as well as recorded human history suggests otherwise. The
 innate limitations of instinctive human social behavior appears to
 impose natural limits on the ability of human beings to achieve a state
 of true civilized existence.  Government appears to be an inevitable
 fact of life, and human civilizations are doomed to fail and collapse.
 I challenge and implore the readership of the Voluntaryist to find
 fatal flaws with my hypothesis.
