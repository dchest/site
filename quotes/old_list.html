     From time to time, readers of ANALYSIS urge upon me the espousal of some program they are pleased to call "constructive." ...
<br>
     Every one of the proposed reforms has something to commend it, while the sincerity of the proponents makes one wish they might succeed. The fact remains, however, that the reform invariably rests its case on the good-will, intelligence, and selflessness of men who, invested with the power to do so, will put the reform into operation. And the lesson of history is that power is never so used. Never. I am convinced, on the other hand, that all of the evils of which these honest people complain can be traced to the misuse of power, and am therefore inclined to distrust political power of any kind. ... The only "constructive" idea that I can in all conscience advance, then, is that the individual put his trust in himself, not in power; that he seek to better his understanding and lift his values to a higher and still higher level; that he assume responsibility for his behavior and not shift his responsibility to committees, organizations, and, above all, a superpersonal State. Such reforms as are necessary will come of themselves when, or if, men act as intelligent and responsible human beings. There cannot be a "good" society until there are "good" men.

“These ... people don't see anything criminal about
a little homemade brew. Try and understand their point
of view.The know-how has been handed down for
centuries. During all that time, whiskey has been used
as their most common drug to doctor everything from
colds to snake bite to heart trouble. They figure that
it's their grain that goes into the whiskey. They grew
it. They got together a few pieces of copper tubing
and some other odds and ends and put together a
little contraption on their land. To them, that's no more
morally wrong than their wives making wild
strawberry preserves in their kitchens or soap from
lye drippings in their yards.”

“The practical reason for freedom, then, is that
freedom seems to be the only condition under which
any kind of substantial moral fibre can be developed.
Everything else has been tried [and failed]. ... In
suggesting that we try freedom ... the anarchist ... has
a strictly practical aim. He aims at the production of a
race of responsible beings. ... His desire for freedom
has but one practical object, ie, that men may
become as good and as decent, as elevated and noble,
as they might be and really wish to be. Reason,
experience, and observation lead him to the
conviction that under absolute and unqualified
freedom they can and rather promptly will, educate
themselves to this desirable end; but that so long as
they are the least degree dominated by legalism and
authoritarianism, they never can.” <br>

“Slavery the worst form of Stealing.
Whatever may be said of other possessions, a man's
person is his own; his life is his own; his liberty is his
own. He who takes them away without his consent,
and without any crime on his part, steals them. And
surely stealing men is a much greater crime than
stealing money, as a human being holds a higher rank
in the scale of existence than inert and senseless
matter. The eighth commandment, then, forbids,
distinctly and peremptorily, all the despotic enslaving
of our fellow men, of whatever condition or color, or
of exercising absolute lordship over them; because
those acts virtually deprive human beings of that
property in themselves with which the Creator
endowed them. This is a usurpation of the rights of
man which no usage, law or custom, can legalize in
the sight of heaven. No title can make good my claim
to another's person; no deed of inheritance or
conveyance transmits it to a third party. ... Every man
under God, owns himself; He has a right to himself
which no other man can challenge. I may be lawfully
restrained, punished, and even executed by just laws;
but I can never be owned; I can never be in the sight
of God, either serf or slave; I cannot sell myself;
no other can sell me. - Though I may, for a
consideration, make over to another my right to
my services, yet the right to myself is no more
alienable by myself than by another.”

he will use his own judgment. On the other hand, a
reckless banker will find a way to do what his greed
desires, no matter what the law is, even a legal way.”

    <br>-French Proverb<hr><br><br>
The power [of coining money] itself is a frivolous one, of little or no utility; for the weighing and assaying of metals is a thing so easily done, and can be done by so many different persons, that there is certainly no necessity for it being done at all by a government,. And it would undoubtedly have been far better if all coins - whether coined by governments or individuals - had all been made into pieces bearing simply the names of pounds, ounces, pennyweights, etc., and containing just the amounts of pure metal described by those weights. The coins would have then been regarded as only so much metal; and as having only the same value as the same amount of metal in any other form. Men would then have known exactly how much of certain metals they were buying, selling, and promising to pay. And all the jugglery, cheating, and robbery that governments have practised, and licensed individuals to practise - by coining pieces bearing the same names, but having different amounts of metal - would have been avoided.

"Paper 'Money"'
      The Chinese invented paper "money" at the end of the eighth or beginning
of the ninth century AD. Its original name was 'flying money' because it was so
light and could blow out of one's hand.<br>
- Robert Temple, THE GENIUS OF CHINA (1986), p. 117. <hr><br> <br>

      If precious metal coins are in circulation which are intrinsically
worth their true value, the only kind of counterfeiting possible is with false,
disguised metals. This has often been done, and was a major impetus to alchemy,
and the manufacture of spurious gold and silver. But paper money invited counterfeiting
by its very nature, since the essence of it is not its inherent substance but the
authority on which it was issued. Paper money is a symbol. To counterfeit is
therefore not to fabricate a substance but to impersonate the authority issuing it.
Since anyone can print on pieces of paper, the authority must make the processes of
 manufacture of its paper money so intricate that they cannot be exactly reproduced.<br>

      "Many politicians of our time are in the habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition, that no people ought to be free till they are fit to use their freedom. The maxim is worthy of the fool in the old story, who resolved not to go into the water till he had learned to swim. If men are to wait for liberty till they become wise and good in slavery they may indeed wait for ever."

      "The man who owns a slave, or lives by exploiting others, whether slave or not, is not himself a free man. He is a man who must look over his shoulder all the time, in fear. True freedom lies in a deep concern for the freedom of others, and if this is accepted it should make every man, out of pure selfishness, the ardent devotee of the freedom of his neighbor."

      Power can rarely be wielded effectively over long periods of time unless it is perceived by the community in which it is exercised as a form of legitimate authority, not as mere coercive force.

[T]o proclaim a people free to choose their own government but then to insist that the government
 determine, through a government-controlled compulsory educational system, the very attitudes and values
by which the people will choose becomes the most insidious and pernicious form of tyranny: it gives the
people the illusion of freedom while all along controlling them through a form of governmental programming.
-Blair Adams, WHO OWNS THE CHILDREN? (1991), p. 46. <hr><br> <br>

      The fact that wholesale prices remain about the same over a given time period is no indication that monetary inflation is not occurring. As "Austrian" business cycle theory has pointed out, any bank credit inflation sets up conditions for boom-and-bust; there is no need for prices to actually rise. The reason that this is possible is that increased production of goods and services suffices to offset the effects of monetary expansion. In the events leading up to the great crash of 1929, most economists of the day held that a stable wholesale price level cannot, by definition, be inflationary. In reality, the unhampered free-market economy will usually increase the supply of goods and services and thereby bring about a gently falling price level, as happened in most of the nineteenth century except during wartime.

      I was once asked if I thought the 'Founding Fathers' had good intentions. I replied that this was subjective and irrelevant. The only pertinent issue is whether they or any present day advocates of constitutional government believe[d] that protection and the other services governments provide should be provided on a voluntary basis. Would they arrest and place in jail a person who refused to contribute to the government?
