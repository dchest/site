             <h2>A Voluntaryist Contest<br>
            How Do You Explain to People That Taxation Is Theft?</h2>
            </center>
            	Our contest rules are shown below for historical purposes.  Congratulations to Marco den Ouden for his winning entry, <a href='/articles/sophslav.html'>Sophisticated Slavery</a>!
                <br/><br/>
                If you are interested in educating others about voluntaryism, if you are interested in delegitimizing the State, if you are interested in helping people understand why they must withdraw their cooperation and consent from the State, this is the contest for you!
                <br/><br/>
                Those of you who have followed my writings in THE VOLUNTARYIST know that taxation is an anathema to me. Why it should be so is perhaps mostly a matter of logic. As Lysander Spooner pointed out, government is dependent on money and men. With money, it can hire soldiers and police; with soldiers and police it can enforce its edicts and collect more money to support itself. Murray Rothbard in his classic definition of the State refers both to its coercive monopolization of a certain geographic area and its forcible collection of revenues, known as taxation. Without the ability to collect taxes we would begin to see the demise of the State.
                <br/><br/>
                As much as I have written in opposition to taxation, I still feel much like the voice crying in the wilderness. For whatever reason, few have joined in my crusade to persuade people that the stealing commandment applies to both individuals and governments and the people working on their behalf.
                <br/><br/>
                It was recently pointed out to me by our webmaster, Dave Scotese, that practically all people agree that stealing is wrong, but that most of them do not see taxation as theft. This was a new way of addressing the problem. Dave suggested I adjust my focus by finding the best methods and/or best arguments for convincing non-voluntaryists that taxation is stealing.
                <br/><br/>
                That is the crux of our contest:
                <br/><br/>
                HOW DO WE BEST EXPLAIN THE VOLUNTARYIST POSITION AND BRING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT TAXATION IS THEFT?
                <br/><br/>
                Here are the rules.
