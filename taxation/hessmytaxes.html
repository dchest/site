 <h2>My Taxes</h2>
 <h4>by Karl Hess<br>

</center>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">     On
April 15 [1969], I sent the following letter, accompanying my filled-out
1040 Form to the Tax Collector:</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">     The
Declaration of Independence of the United States of America establishes
a bill of particulars in regard to intolerable infringements. abuses,
and denials of political power which belongs to the people.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">     The
Federal government of the United States of America today is guilty of
exactly every sort of infringement, abuse, and denial stated as intolerable
by the Declaration of Independence.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">     I
cannot, in conscience, sanction that government by the payment of taxes.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">     Further,
the Federal government of the United States of America has established
as a principle, and ruthlessly by the power of its officials enforces
as a practice, that it can demand the primary loyalty of the people,
that it can exercise all political power on their behalf, that it can
wage war without their approval, and that it can and should establish
the standards of their behavior and the goals of their lives.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">     I
could not in conscience sanction such a government by the payment of
taxes.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">     Finally,
the Declaration of Independence, in the clearest possible language,
tells Americans that when a government become destructive of the ends
of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that it is the right
and duty of the people to abolish such government, to &quot;throw off
such government.&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">     It
is in the spirit of that Declaration, and in comradeship with men everywhere
who seek freedom and to throw off such government, that I now refuse
to pay the taxes demanded by the government in the attached form.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">[This letter originally appeared
in THE LIBERTARIAN, May 1, 1969, p. 3.]</font></p>
