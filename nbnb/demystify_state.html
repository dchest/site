<h2>Demystifying the State</h2>
<h3>Wendy McElroy</h3>

<p>Mystification is the process by which the commonplace is elevated to the level
  of the divine by those who have a vested interest in its unassailability. Government
  is a perfect example of mystification at work. Government is a group of individuals
  organized for the purpose of extracting wealth and exerting power over people
  and resources in a given geographic area. Ordinarily people object to and resist
  thieves and robbers; but in the case of government, they do not because the government
  has created a mystique of legitimacy about its activities.</p>
<p>&quot;Government is founded on opinion,&quot; wrote William Godwin. &quot;A
  nation must have learned to respect a king, before a king can exercise any authority
  over them.&quot; Past governments used the divine right of kings, by which monarchs
  claimed the divinity of being appointed to rule by God, as a means of instilling
  this respect; rebellion against the king became rebellion against the will of
  God. Contemporary governments have replaced this with the legitimacy derived
  from such concepts as &quot;democracy,&quot; &quot;equality,&quot; the &quot;motherland,&quot;
  or the &quot;American way of life.&quot; Such patriotic concepts have the ability
  to rouse feelings of awe and reverence in the population. These reactions are
  ingeniously channeled to support the government, and in turn help create the
  mystique of legitimacy which governments need to survive.</p>
<p>In a libertarian context, the issue of state legitimacy reduces to one question:
  Does any individual or group have the right to initiate force? For the libertarian,
  it is always illegitimate to initiate force against nonaggressors. Libertarianism
  is the political philosophy based on the concept of self-ownership; that is,
  every human being, simply by being a human being, has moral justification over
  his or her own body. This jurisdiction, which is called individual rights, cannot
  properly be violated, for this would be tantamount to claiming that human beings
  are not self-owners.</p>
<p>If individuals cannot properly violate rights, then it cannot be proper for
  any organization or group of individuals to do so. Certainly the number of people
  involved in initiating aggression has no bearing on whether or not the violation
  of rights is legitimate. This was clearly pointed out by a 17th-century libertarian
  who wrote:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>What can be more absurd in nature and contrary to all common sense than to
  call him Thief and kill him that comes alone with a few to rob me; and to call
  him Lord Protector and obey him that robs me with regiments and troops? As if
  to rove with 2 or 3 ships were to be a Pirate, but with 50 an Admiral? But if
  it be the number of adherents only, not the cause, that makes the difference
  between a Robber and a Protector: I will that number were defined, that the
  Prince begins. And be able to distinguish between a Robbery and a Tax. </blockquote></p>
<p>. . . Without a doubt, the most effective method by which the state creates
  a mystique is through control of education. The evolution of compulsory state-controlled
  schooling reads like a history of political maneuvering, in which the goal of
  teaching children literacy skills plays a minor role. Public education is by
  no means inept or disordered as it is made out to be. It is an ice- cold, superb
  machine designed to perform one very important job. The problem is not that
  public schools do not work well, but rather that they do. The first goal and
  primary function of schools is not to educate good people, but good citizens.
  It is the function which we normally label state indoctrination.</p>
<p>The early supporters of state education understood this. Horace Mann, for example,
  a 19th-century supporter of public education, saw it as a means of assimilating
  foreign elements into an otherwise established Protestant, puritan culture.
  With regard to the Irish Catholics, Mann maintained:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>With the old not much can be done; but with their children, the great remedy
  is education. The rising generation must be taught as our children are taught.
  We say must be, because in many cases this can only be accomplished by coercion.
  . . . Children must be gathered up and forced into schools and those who resist
  and impede this plan, whether parents or priests, must be held accountable and
  punished. </blockquote></p>
<p>From their inception, public schools were a form of social control. One Irish
  newspaper, which represented those children being unwillingly assimilated, observed:</p>
<p> <blockquote>The general principle upon which these compulsory schooling laws are based
  is radically unsound, untrue, and A-theistical. . . . It is that the education
  of children is not the work of the Church, or of the Family, but that it is
  the work of the State. </blockquote></p>
<p>In contrast to the xenophobic fever with which many native Americans rushed
  to impose their cultural preferences upon immigrants, libertarians condemned
  state schools. Josiah Warren compared them to &quot;paying the fox to take care
  of the chickens.&quot; He realized that state control of education, like state
  control of religion, would create an orthodoxy which would suppress dissenting
  views. It would become a bureaucracy to serve the interest of the bureaucrats
  and those who ultimately controlled the state apparatus. When the statists insisted
  that compulsory, regulated education was necessary because people could not
  distinguish truth from falsehood and might be led astray, Herbert Spencer countered:
  &quot;There is hardly a single department of life over which, for similar reasons,
  legislative supervision has not been, nor may be, established.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, the ideal of social control through education has been realized. Like
  Pavlovian dogs, children enter and exit schools to the sound of bells. They
  begin each day by pledging allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
  and by singing the national anthem. Through political science and history classes,
  which present severely slanted history, they are taught to revere democracy
  and the Constitution. School is &quot;the twelve-year sentence&quot; during
  which children are molded into good citizens. Indeed, as we have seen, the chief
  function of education is to train obedient citizens. &quot;It is inevitable
  that compulsory, state-regulated schooling will reflect the philosophy of the
  status quo,&quot; commented historian Joel Spring. &quot;It is after all those
  who have political and social power who gain the most benefit from the existing
  political climate and depend on its continuation.&quot; In practical terms,
  the public school system has assumed the role of an official church by imbuing
  its subjects with a genuflecting respect for the state.</p>
<p>The state projects an image of massive strength, the image of a self-perpetuating,
  self-contained institution upon whose goodwill the people depend. In fact, the
  reverse is true. Government rests upon the goodwill of the people. Without their
  support, it becomes fragile and will eventually disintegrate. A government is
  no more powerful than the human resources, the skills, the knowledge, and attitudes
  of obedience it commands. Every dollar the state spends has been taken from
  an individual. It has no resources of its own. Every law it maintains is enforced
  by an individual. As &Eacute;tienne de la Bo&eacute;tie, observed of the state:
  &quot;He who abuses you so has only two eyes, has but two hands, one body, and
  has naught but what the least man . . . except for the advantage you give him
  to destroy.&quot; That advantage is what we call the sanction of the victim
  or the consent which the oppressed must give to their oppressors.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is a direct attack upon the mystique of the state. It recognizes
  that the state is only an abstraction and reduces it to the actions of individuals.
  It applies the same standard of morality to the state as it would to a next-door
  neighbor. If it is not proper for a neighbor to tax or pass laws regulating
  your private life, then it cannot be proper for the state to do so. Only by
  elevating itself above the standards of personal morality can the state make
  these claims on your life. . . .</p>
<p>Conservatives and liberals demand different varieties of law and order without
  regard to the fact that the ultimate in order may be found in a concentration
  camp. On the surface, it might seem that conservatives and liberals are engaged
  in deadly combat, but they are actually in fundamental agreement on one crucial
  methodological point: namely, that the state is a proper means of achieving
  social change--that the use of force legitimized by the state is a proper way
  of controlling other people's peaceful activities. This is their fundamental
  disagreement with libertarianism.</p>
<p>William Godwin formulated the libertarian rejection of force in epistemological
  terms:</p>
<p> <blockquote>Force is an expedient, the use of which must be deplored. It is contrary to
  the intellect, which cannot be improved but by conviction and persuasion. Violence
  corrupts the man who employs it and the man upon whom it is employed. </blockquote></p>
<p>. . . The battle against statism today is not a battle against any particular
  politician. The issue is deeper. It is a battle against a way of thinking, a
  way of viewing the state. The main victory of the state has been within the
  minds of the people who obey. In commenting on the British rule over India,
  Leo Tolstoy wrote:</p>
<p> <blockquote>A commercial company enslaves a nation comprising two hundred millions. Tell
  this to a man free from superstition and he will fail to grasp what those words
  mean. What does it mean that thirty thousand men . . . have subdued two hundred
  million? Do the figures make clear that it is not the English who have enslaved
  the Indians, but the Indians who have enslaved themselves? </blockquote></p>
<p>People today enslave themselves when all that freedom requires is the word
  &quot;No.&quot; </p>
