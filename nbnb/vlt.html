<h2>Voluntaryism in the Libertarian Tradition</h2>
<h3>by Carl Watner</h3>

<p>Voluntaryism figures prominently in the libertarian tradition in three distinct
ways. First, voluntaryism represents the final goal of all libertarians. After
all, libertarianism is the doctrine that all the affairs of people, both public
and private, should be carried out by individuals or their voluntary associations.
Secondly, voluntaryism is a realization about the nature of political society.
The voluntaryist approach rests on the crucial, theoretical insight that all tyranny
and government are grounded on general popular acceptance. The primary responsibility
for the existence and continuation of any political system rests on the majority
of the population, who willingly acquiesce in their own subjection. Thirdly, voluntaryism
represents a way of achieving significant social change without resort to politics
or violent revolution. Since voluntaryists realize that government rests on popular
consent, they conclude that the only way to abolish government power is simply
for the people at large to withdraw that consent. As a means, voluntaryism calls
for peaceful persuasion, education, civil disobedience, and non-violent resistance
to the State. To libertarians, voluntaryism thus represents a means, an end, and
an insight. Only voluntary means can be used to attain the truly voluntary society,
based on the insight that existing tyrannies depend on the voluntary submission
of the governed. The purpose of this essay is to elucidate the history, the development,
and the actual practice of these ideas within the context of the libertarian tradition.
<p>These three aspects of voluntaryism mutually reinforce each other. The very
  goal of an all-voluntary society suggests its own means. The means are the seeds
  which bud into flowers and come into fruition. It is impossible to plant the
  seed of coercion and reap the flower of liberty. Thus politics and government,
  which libertarians view as essentially coercive processes, can never legitimately
  be used to attain libertarian goals. The non-voluntaryist always proposes to
  compel people to do something; usually by passing laws or electing politicians
  to office. These laws and officials depend upon political action and physical
  violence. Voluntaryistic means, like non-violent resistance, for example, violate
  no one's rights. They only serve to nullify laws and politicians by ignoring
  them. Voluntaryism does not require of people that they shall violently overthrow
  their government or every use the electoral process to change it; but merely
  that they shall cease to support their government, whereupon it will fall of
  its own dead weight.</p>
<p>Etienne de la Boetie (1530-1563), the first libertarian political philosopher
  in the Western world, was largely responsible for the original statement and
  elaboration of the voluntaryist principle. In his Discourse On Voluntary Servitude,
  probably written during the mid 1550's, la Boetie discussed one of the roost
  critical problems of political philosophy; namely, the question of civil obedience.
  &quot;Why in the world do people consent to their own enslavement?&quot;, he
  asked. &quot;Why do the bulk of the people acquiesce in their own subjection?&quot;
  La Boetie answered these questions by explaining the governmental mystique created
  by rulers and their intellectual apologists. By relying on custom, by providing
  bread and circuses to the citizenry, and by creating a vast network of governmental
  supporters dependent on political plunder, governments were able to engineer
  and sustain their own popular acceptance among the populace.</p>
<p>La Boetie's voluntaryist insight, that consent is brought about largely by
  government propaganda, speaks sharply to the problem of strategy. It leads directly
  to the conclusion that mass civil disobedience and mass non-violent resistance
  are the only true methods for overthrowing tyranny. Realizing the great value
  of natural liberty, la Boetie called for a thorough process of educating the
  public to the truth, a process which would give back to the people a knowledge
  of the blessings of liberty and a knowledge of the myths and illusions fostered
  by the State. The primary task of opponents of tyranny is an educational one;
  to alert the public to their despotic condition, to demystify and desanctify
  the entire State apparatus. La Boetie was thus the first political philosopher
  to move from an emphasis on the importance of consent to the strategic importance
  of toppling tyranny by leading the public to withdraw their consent.</p>
<p>The value of la Boetie's insights were somewhat lost to the 16th and 17th Century
  English, yet voluntaryism played a significant part in the struggle between
  Church and State during these centuries. During the mid-17th Century, the English
  Independents were moving towards a completely voluntaryistic conception of the
  Church. They considered that maintenance of churches by tithes and State support
  ought to be done away with. This was no new idea and for a long period there
  had been Independents who realized that this was the logical outcome of their
  views of separation of Church and State. For example, a petition circulated
  in London in 1647, demanded that &quot;tithes and all other enforced maintenance
  may be forever abolished, and nothing in the place thereof imposed; but that
  all ministers be paid only by those who voluntarily chose them and contract
  with them for their labors.&quot; By substituting 'taxes' for 'tithes' and 'governmental
  officials' for ministers', we realize how close these early religious dissenters
  were to espousing the ideas of a truly voluntary State. The early advocates
  of church-state separation were in the vanguard of the libertarian tradition
  because they took one of the first steps necessary to separate the State from
  all the rest of society.</p>
<p>In these religious controversies, the term 'voluntaryism' was representative
  of those who advocated complete separation of Church and State. The term itself
  came into common usage during the extensive disputes between the Churchmen and
  dissenters in Scotland during the second decade of the 19th Century. It was
  then picked up by the English non-conformists during the 1830's, and applied
  to their agitation to keep the English government out of the educational process.
  The 'voluntary educationists' saw a religious threat in State controlled education
  and many believed that the law of supply and demand, or the voluntary principle,
  as they termed it, would provide for the education of the whole English people.
  Auberon Herbert attempted to repopularize the term during the 1880's and the
  1890's in his voluntaryist journal, Free Life. William Godwin, author of an
  Enquiry Concerning Political Justice in 1793, offers a good example of voluntaryistic
  thinking in late 18th Century England. It is interesting to note that revolutionary
  violence never became a serious threat to England because of the Influence of
  the religious non-conformist teachings among the working classes. Godwin, among
  other extreme political thinkers of that era, believed that physical force was
  too uncertain in its results and that peaceful resistance was more desirable
  and effective. Godwin argued for reasonable discussion and disciplined non-cooperation
  as the means of fighting against authority. In Political Justice (Book II, Chap.
  III, and Book IV, Chap. 1) he urged that &quot;all government is founded in
  opinion. Men at present live under any particular form, because they conceive
  it their interest to do so. ... Destroy this opinion, and the fabric which is
  built upon it falls to the ground.&quot; &quot;Make men wise and by that very
  operation you make them free. Civil liberty follows as a consequence of this;
  no usurped power can stand against the artillery of opinion.&quot;</p>
<p>Godwin, in one important particular, was at variance with the main tradition
  of dissent in the 18th Century. A large body of dissenters thought in terms
  of politics; they tended to see problems as political and to seek political
  solutions. They favored associations and the normal methods of bringing political
  pressure to bear; they looked to legislative action for a solution of problems.
  Godwin, on the other hand, looked only to the reformation of the individual,
  objected to political parties, and had no faith in political solutions of what
  were for him simply moral problems. The voluntaryistic dissenters believed that
  moral agitation was always more effective and more proper than political activity.</p>
<p>The 19th Century abolitionists both in England and the United States, struggling
  to abolish slavery and the slave trade, were faced with similar problems. Was
  slave-holding to be abolished by moral suasion or political means? Should abolitionists
  participate in party politics or should they hold aloof from such controversies?
  Should they create their own third party organizations to propagate the abolition
  of slavery? The radical abolitionists were on the cutting edge of the libertarian
  movement because they viewed slavery as the worst form of stealing. Slavery
  was called 'man-stealing' because it reflected the theft of a person's self-ownership
  rights. The problems faced by the 19th Century abolitionists, both in terms
  of goals and strategy, have much to say about the place of voluntaryism in the
  libertarian movement today.</p>
<p>William Lloyd Garrison led one wing of the abolitionist movement, and it is
  his views which we shall first examine. By the mid 1840's, Garrison and his
  chief lieutenants, Wendell Phillips and Henry Clarke Wright, had come to the
  conclusion that all office-holding and voting was wrong and morally reprehensible.
  These men arrived at their views in two different ways. During the 1830's, Garrison
  had addressed himself to the issues of perfectionism and non-resistance. He
  and his fellow non-resistants rejected not only war, but the entire apparatus
  that sustained government in power. He summarized their position in the 1838
  Declaration of Sentiments adopted by the Peace Convention held in Boston that
  year. Non-resistants renounced all allegiance to human governments and disabled
  themselves from holding any political office. This carried with it a rejection
  of voting. &quot;If we cannot occupy a seat in the legislature or on the bench,
  neither can we elect others to act as our substitutes in any such capacity.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1841, Garrison and his followers underwent a further transformation, which
  led to a reinforcement of their beliefs against political action. The Liberty
  Party, which had been purposely formed as an anti-slavery party in 1840, appalled
  Garrison, both as a matter of theory and tactics. He claimed that an anti-slavery
  third party would split the movement and dilute anti-slavery principles by dragging
  them into the political gutter. Nearly at the same time, the Garrisonians came
  to the realization that the Constitution was actually a pro-slavery document
  and that disunion should be the rule of the day. They came to see the Constitution
  as &quot;a covenant with death and an agreement with hell&quot; and therefore
  advocated personal disallegiance from the federal government and sectional disunion
  from the South.</p>
<p>This outlook on the Constitution was only developed after the Garrisonians
  had been preaching their non-resistance and no-voting theories for a number
  of years. Since Garrison took all of these demands seriously, he came to condemn
  voting not only for all non-resistants but for all enfranchised citizens. He
  took the ground that to vote for any public officer, local, state, or federal,
  would be to endorse someone who would have to take an oath to uphold the United
  States Constitution which supported slavery. Any act of allegiance to a government
  whose constitution supported slavery &quot;means either to undertake to execute
  the law which I think wrong or to appoint another to do so&quot; for me.</p>
<p>The Garrisonian ideas were propagated in many forums. Garrison himself engaged
  in a debate with James Birney, soon to be head of the Liberty Party, in the
  late 1830's. In this &quot;Letter on the Political Obligations of Abolitionists&quot;,
  Garrison maintained that the political reformation which would bring about the
  abolition of slavery &quot;is to be expected solely by a change in the moral
  vision of the people; - not by attempting to prove that it is the duty of every
  abolitionist to be a voter, but that it is the duty of every voter to be an
  abolitionist.&quot; It was, in his opinion, the general object of the antislavery
  movement to so &quot;affect public sentiment ...and alter the views and feelings
  of the people in regard to the crime of slave holding, that all classes of society...
  may be induced to rally together en masse for the entire abolition of slavery.&quot;
  Garrison's field was not the field of political action but that of moral suasion.
  In seeking to reform public sentiment that lay behind laws and constitutions,
  Garrison was striking at the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>Both of Garrison's chief helpers, Phillips and Wright, independently expressed
  their anti-political views. Phillips wrote of his &quot;No-Voting Theory&quot;
  in the Liberator during the 1844 and then further clarified his views in his
  1845 pamphlet, &quot;Can Abolitionists Vote or Take Office under the United
  States Constitution?&quot; Henry Clarke Wright had earlier formulated his views
  in his 1841 booklet on &quot;Ballot Box and Battle Field&quot;. Wright maintained
  the non-resistant position, claiming that the ballot box was at most only a
  make-shift substitute for the violence of bullets on the battle field. According
  to his lights, no man could honestly accept the office of voter and then vote
  against the existence of government. &quot;May a man consent to be invested
  with power to do an evil and swear to do it, even for the purpose of abolishing
  that evil?&quot;, he asked. Wright claimed that a man may never rightfully consent
  to do what he thinks wrong. He who would do it proves himself dishonest. &quot;He
  consents to be vested with power to do what he acknowledges to be wrong, and
  swears to do it, and then gravely assures us that he never intended to do it.
  Such a man is unworthy of any trust.&quot; Thus Wright concluded the fact that
  any man, knowing the nature and duties of a Congressman or President, &quot;will
  consent to hold these offices, is of itself sufficient evidence that he is not
  a true and good man.&quot; Wright summarized his argument by stating that he
  would not vote, even if by his one vote he could free all the slaves.</p>
<p>Wendell Phillips in his consideration of the question: can abolitionists vote
  or take office under the Constitution? came to a very simple conclusion; namely,
  that they could not. The position of non-voter,and conscientious objector to
  the government was to be jealously guarded. In a land where the ballot is idolized,
  the non-voter &quot;kindles in every beholder's bosom something of the warm
  sympathy which waits on the persecuted, carries with it all the weight of a
  disinterested testimony to truth and pricks each voter's conscience with an
  uneasy doubt, whether after all voting is right. There is constantly a Mordecai
  in the gate.&quot; Phillips sustained his claim that &quot;it is by no means
  necessary that every man should actually vote, in order to influence his times,&quot;
  by citing the historical examples of conscientious objectors who wielded a moral
  influence widely disproportionate to their numbers.</p>
<p>Other wings of the radical abolitionist movement supported the no-voting stance
  taken by the Garrisonians. Nathaniel Peabody Rogers, long-time editor of the
  New Hampshire Anti-Slavery Society journal, Herald of Freedom, noted that men
  in this country have been brought up to believe that nothing can be accomplished
  except by political methods. &quot;They cannot understand how any sane mind
  can discern any other way to any end.&quot; The only object of party politics,
  for Rogers, was Power. &quot;To get it or preserve it is the only possible motive.&quot;
  Rogers realized that the vote which a man casts is but a very insignificant
  emblem of his political power. &quot;The influence which goes out from every
  man, whether for good or evil, can be but very imperfectly measured by the standard
  of a ballot. What he seems to lose by the withdrawal of his single vote, is
  gained 100 fold in the increased force which is given to the testimony of the
  lips and of the life by that disinterested act. ... We only know that we are
  following the dictates of plain, practical common sense, in refusing to commit
  what we see to be a crime, in order to extirpate another crime. We will not
  consent to obtain power by false pretenses, even for the purpose of abolishing
  slavery.&quot; Rogers realized the futility of gaining power temporarily; for
  what can be voted up today, may be voted down tomorrow.</p>
<p>Lysander Spooner was another radical abolitionist who totally rejected voting
  and political party activity. Prior to the Civil War, Spooner had been asked
  to lend his support to the Liberty Party. He refused in no uncertain terms in
  his letter of March 12, 1856:</p>
<p> I feel at liberty standing outside of the constitution and knowing that government
  of some kind will be carried on in the name of the constitution - to interpret
  the constitution, on those points wherein it is right, and then appeal to those,
  who professed to be governed by it, to act up to their own standard. I do this
  on the same principle that, standing outside the Mohammedan religion, I should
  feel at liberty to interpret the Koran, and appeal to believers to act up to
  their own creed, wherein it was right. It is on this ground that I write about
  the constitution, and not because I ever intend to take any part, directly or
  indirectly, in administering it. I think no robbery is more flagrant or palpable
  - nor hardly any more unjustifiable - than taxing men for the support of government,
  without their personal consent. ... Such taxation is not only robbery in itself,
  but it supplies the means for, and is the legitimate parent of, nearly all the
  other tyranny, which governments practice. You will see therefore that it is
  impossible for me to support any government that acts on that principle, or
  to act with any party that adopts it. </p>
<p>Spooner echoed Henry Clarke Wright's analysis of voting and consent. Wright
  wrote that &quot;when a man consents to receive and exercise the right of suffrage
  ... he consents that a majority shall rule and pledges himself to aid in executing
  the will of the majority. Whether he votes with the majority or not, by consenting
  to vote at all, he becomes responsible for whatever it does.&quot; Spooner wrote,
  &quot;I would advocate natural law and constitutional law, wherever I could
  get an audience to listen; because all men in office and out of office are bound
  by them without regard to minorities or majorities among the people. But I do
  not rely upon 'political machinery' (although it may or may not do good, according
  as its objects are, or are not legal and constitutional) - but I do not rely
  upon it as such - because the principle of it is wrong. For it admits (and this
  is my objection to it) that even under a constitution, the law depends upon
  the will of majorities, for the time being, as indicated by the acts of the
  legislature. It admits the right of majorities - even under a constitution which
  purports to fix men's rights - to make and unmake laws at pleasure - or at least
  with very little limitation.&quot;</p>
<p>After the Civil War, Spooner wrote in his No Treason pamphlets that voting
  and tax-paying were not legal evidence of assent to the Constitution. Both were
  done under duress and were, in effect, acts of self-defense. Spooner never maintained
  that people should vote or that voting was proper. Rather he argued, that when
  and if people vote, their actions were not to be interpreted as unquestioning
  obedience to the Constitution. Spooner eventually concluded that no one should
  have the right to vote or make laws. &quot;No human being, nor any number of
  human beings, have any right to make laws, and compel other human beings to
  obey them. To say that they have is to say that they are masters and owners
  of those whom they require obedience.&quot; In the final analysis, Spooner rejected
  the Constitution and politics entirely: &quot;This much is certain - the Constitution
  either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to
  prevent it. In either case, it is unfit to exist.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry David Thoreau, the famous civil resistant, was most sympathetic to the
  abolitionist cause. Thoreau was influenced by his friendship with Ralph Waldo
  Emerson, who in turn was an admirer of William Lloyd Garrison. All three shared
  in common the idea of individual conscience standing in opposition to the State.
  The core of Thoreau's argument is that men become machines when they obey orders
  without thinking or when they give the government authority to speak or act
  on their behalf. &quot;Must the citizen ... resign his conscience to the legislator?&quot;,
  Thoreau asked. &quot;Why has every man a conscience, then? I think that we should
  be men first. ... It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so
  much as for the right. ... Law never made a man a whit more just; and, by means
  of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of
  injustice.&quot; Thoreau was speaking out against slavery as well as against
  the American invasion of Mexico, which took place in 1846.</p>
<p>Thoreau was particularly out-spoken against voting. He saw voting as a sort
  of gaming. &quot;The character of the voters is not staked. ... Even voting
  for the right is doing nothing for it. ... A wise man will not leave the right
  to the mercy of chance, nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority.
  There is but little virtue in the action of masses of men.&quot; Thoreau recognized
  the importance of civil disobedience, both as an individual moral statement
  and tactical position. Referring to his own short imprisonment and his influence,
  Thoreau wrote: &quot;If any think that their influence would be lost [in prison],
  and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the State, ...they do not know
  how much truth is stronger than error, nor how much more eloquently and effectively
  he can combat injustice who has experienced a little in his own person.&quot;</p>
<p>Adopting la Boetie's strategic outlook, he then wrote:</p>
<p> &quot;Cast your whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your influence.
  A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a
  minority then; but it is irrestible when it clogs by its whole weight. ... If
  a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be
  a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State
  to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition
  of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. If the taxgatherer, or any
  other public of ficer, asks me, as one has done, 'But what shall I do?' my answer
  is, 'If you really wish to do anything, resign your office. 'When the subject
  has refused allegiance, and the officer has resigned his office, then the revolution
  is accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus concludes our brief survey of voluntaryism in the libertarian tradition.
  Voluntaryism in the hands of 20th Century libertarians has a revolutionary potential
  that has not been adequately recognized. If we wish to remain true to our libertarian
  heritage, it is clear that voluntaryism as a means, an end, and an insight,
  deserves our support at this time.</p>
