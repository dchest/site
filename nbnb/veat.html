<h2>Voluntaryism in the European Anarchist Tradition</h2>

<h3>Carl Watner</h3>

<b>Introduction</b></p>

<p> Voluntaryism, the doctrine that the State should be abolished
through peaceful, non-electoral means, has been advocated by anarchists
both in Europe and America. My earlier pamphlets, Voluntaryism in the
Libertarian Tradition and A Voluntaryist Bibliography, Annotated
generally dealt with the roots of the anti-electoral, voluntaryist
tradition and its manifestations in the United States and England. This
essay, however, deals primarily with the expression of this tradition
by European anarchists. The picture presented here is not an
exaggerated view of the anti-political nature of European anarchism,
but it is one seen through a single lens. There are many other aspects
and elements of European anarchism, which, although not examined here,
are still important. Nevertheless, any historical judgment will credit
anti-parliamentarianism as one of the most important and long-lasting
aspects of the anarchist tradition, both in Europe and North America.</p>

<p> Although Emma Goldman was a naturalized U.S. citizen, her
roots were European and many of the activities and debates she engaged
in involved European affairs. Her appearance in this essay also
epitomizes the difference in emphasis between individualist-anarchists
and collectivist-anarchists. The former have approached libertarian
history from the perspective of the self-ownership principle; that is
anarchists and libertarians were usually defined by their adherence to
the axiom that each person is a self-owner and should control his own
person and justly owned property. Within the context of English and
American history this primarily meant dealing with the radical
individualists and radical abolitionists from the 18th, 19th, and 20th
Centuries. However, the European anarchist tradition never fully
developed this principle of self-ownership in the same manner as the
individualist-anarchists in the English speaking world. It was always
anti-authoritarian and had a more collectivist orientation towards
property ownership than did the individualist tradition.</p>

<p> Anarchists of whatever persuasion always have and always will
view the State as a criminal institution, as a band of thieves and
robbers who violate the person and property rights of their victims. It
is this anarchist insight into the nature of the State - that the State
is inherently and necessarily an invasive institution - which
distinctly identifies the anarchist, whether individualist or
collectivist. What unites them is their commonly shared view of the
State as a criminal gang and as the chief enemy and most dangerous
enemy of all people in society. Where they differ is in their
expectations regarding the form a future anarchist society will take.
Since anarchism is the doctrine that all the affairs of the people
should be conducted on a voluntary basis, it is up to the people who
compose such a society to arrange their affairs as suits them. Many
European anarchists anticipated a communal, or collectivist
organization of society, once the State was abolished. However, as much
as their future expectations differed from those of the individualists,
their approach to social change was voluntaryist and anti-political.
Although the European anarchist tradition was often looked upon as
fraught with the violence of terrorists and war, it included many
nonviolent revolutionaries among its ranks. As we shall see, the
European experiences offer a rich buffet of historical lessons for all
voluntaryists today.</p>

<p>             <b>Proudhon</b></p>

<p> Although one of the earliest popularizers of the term
"anarchism" was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865), another Frenchman,
Anselme Bellegarrigue, his contemporary, was the first to publish a
periodical with an explicitly anarchist title. His L'Anarchie: Journal
De L'Ordre, first appeared in April, 1850. Bellegarrigue was even more
anti-electoral than Proudhon and was explicitly nonviolent. According
to him, the task of abolishing governments "must be carried out neither
by political parties, which will always seek to dominate, nor by
violent revolution, which needs leaders like any other military
operation. The people once enlightened will act for itself." The people
will make its own revolution, by the sole strength of right, the force
of inertia, "the refusal to co-operate." From the refusal to co-operate
stems the abrogation of the laws that legalize murder and the
proclamation of equity.</p>

<p> Both Bellegarrigue and Proudhon stressed the basic freedom and
spontaneity of anarchism and saw that these elements precluded the use
of rigid organizations, particularly anything like a political party,
which sought to seize and hold power, for creating the future society.
"All parties without exception, in so far as they seek for power, are
varieties of absolutism", said Proudhon, and none of his followers have
departed from this position. From his own personal experiences in
parliamentary affairs, Proudhon came to reject parliamentary
institutions because "they mean that the individual abdicates his
sovereignty by handing it over to a representative; once he has done
this, decisions may be reached in his name over which he no longer has
any control." Proudhon opposed democratic parliaments as well as
monarchs, such as Emperor Napoleon III, when he proudly declared:
"Whoever puts his hand on me to govern me is an usurper and a tyrant; I
declare him my enemy."</p>

<p> Proudhon did not begin his "political" career with a rejection
of electoral activity, however. In April 1848, he narrowly missed being
elected to the Constituent Assembly, and in June of that same year he
actually was elected. There is some speculation that he ran for office
with the idea of gathering support for his People's Bank, since he had
already approached a government cabinet minister for assistance in
promoting the project. His experience was disillusioning: "As soon as I
set foot in the Parliamentary Sinai, ... I ceased to be in touch with
the masses; because I was absorbed by my legislative work. I entirely
lost sight of the current of events." It was soon clear that, he was
completely out of place in the Assembly. As he recalled his election of
1848, a year afterwards Proudhon remarked with some justification:
</p><blockquote>When I think of all I have written and
            published for ten years on the role of the state in society,
            on the subordination of power and the revolutionary
            incapacity of government, I am tempted to believe that my
            election was the effect of a misunderstanding on the part of
            the people.</blockquote>

<p> His biographer, George Woodcock, adds, "it seems to have been the
effect of a misunderstanding on his own part as well."</p>

<p> While still in Parliament, Proudhon was charged with sedition
when he denounced Louis-Napoleon. His parliamentary immunity was waived
by his colleagues, and he was sentenced to three years in prison and a
fine of 3000 francs. Thus ended his first involvement in real politics.
Years later, in 1863, when the Bonapartist government held elections,
Proudhon became the center of an anti-voting movement. Committees of
Abstention were set up in Paris and Bourdeaux and Proudhon penned a
detailed exposition of his abstentionist arguments, which appeared in
April 1863, under the title Les Democrates Assermentes et les
Refractaires (Oath-Taking Democrats and Non-Jurors). Despite some
little success, the Committee of Abstention disbanded after the
election. "Yet it bequeathed to the movements that followed it, and
particularly to anarchism and syndicalism, at least two important
elements - the rejection of expediency as a dominant element in
political behaviour, and the rejection of the democratic myth of the
vote as a universal political panacea."</p>

<p> Although Proudhon may not have totally rejected all forms of
parliamentarism and voting, he believed that political parties were
designed to serve the ruling classes. It is certain that his own
political experiences "hardened his distrust of political methods and
helped to create the anti-parliamentartianism that marked his last
years and was inherited by the anarchist movement in general." Besides
Proudhon, there were several other European anarchists with similar
electoral experiences. Karl Grun, one of the most ardent German
converts of Proudhon, served "a short disillusioning period as a
parliamentarian - in the Prussian National Assembly in 1849, ..."
Another anarchist with similar experience was the Dutchman, Ferdinand
Domela Nieuwenhuis, who was also an extreme anti-militarist. He was
elected to parliament in 1888, as a Socialist and he remained there for
three years. Like Proudhon and Grun, he found it a saddening
experience, and emerged a convinced anti-parliamentarian and began
turning towards anarchism. (This also recalls to mind the British
member of Parliament, Auberon Herbert, who evolved into a
voluntaryist.)</p>

<p> The anarchist dissatisfaction with electoral politics was not
totally a one way street. There were prominent anarchists who turned
towards parliamentary socialism, as they became disillusioned with the
possibilities of achieving the "anarchist revolution". Paul Brousse
(1844-1912) was one such personality. He had fallen under the influence
of Bakunin in the early 1870's and became one of the leading exponents
of the anarchist "propaganda by deed" (acts of violent terrorism).
After 1877, he became mainly concerned with the revival of the French
socialist movement. "This revival, combined with the growing isolation
and ineffectiveness of the anarchists, led Brousse to change his ideas
on political tactics, and when he returned to France in 1880, he had
abandoned the central tenet of anarchism, abstention from the use of
the vote, although he continued to believe in the ideal of
anarcho-communist society."</p>

<p> In Brousse's own case, he became disillusioned with the
possibility of terror tactics winning a majority of the masses over to
anarchism and thus became willing to experiment with electoral tactics
instead. However previous to his "political" conversion, in 1875, he
had written a pamphlet critical of universal suffrage, attacking it
both on the basis of the French experience, as well as criticizing its
theoretical shortcomings. In the words of his biographer, Brousse
illustrated "how universal suffrage had been used throughout the
century as an instrument of the bourgeoisie, while posturing as an
expression of the will of the people." Brousse concluded that electoral
agitation would only confirm the bourgeoisie in power.</p>

<p> Despite his anti-electoral outpourings, Brousse swallowed his
pride and turned to electoral action, when his anarchist strategies
failed to bring about any immediate results. He joined with the
socialists and became founder of a political party identified with the
term "possibilism". The "possibilists" had as their aim "to achieve as
soon as possible the organization of public services for the immediate
needs of the working class. One of the ways this could be achieved was
through municipal action" and politics. The choice he made was a way
out of the dilemma faced by anarchists in the late 1870's and 1880's.
For many saw the dogma of electoral abstention only as a tactic and
when it proved ineffective they were ready to resort to electoral
efforts or trade unionism.</p>

<p>             <b>Syndicalism</b></p>

<p> The failure of terror tactics during the 1880's and early
1890's created a disillusionment in anarchist ranks, as we have seen.
This resulted in large numbers of French anarchists becoming
syndicalists and entering workers unions. Revolutionary trade unionism,
or syndicalism as it became known, was premised upon the class struggle
between wage earners (the proletariat) and the State, represented by
property owners and the bourgeoisie. The outcome of the class struggle
would result in a social revolution and the establishment of a
socialist society, in which autonomous syndicates would control each

industry. The syndicates in turn would be controlled by the workers of
that particular branch of industry and would unite in general national
federations. Syndicalists thus combined the Marxian elements of class
struggle and distribution according to need with the collectivist
concept of property and the anarchist idea of statelessness. Syndicates
were unique in that they placed a distinctive emphasis on the role of
the labor union in the struggle against the State and opposed
parliamentary democracy and political weapons in the class struggle.</p>

<p> It was from the two makers of the anarchist tradition,
Proudhon, and Michael Bakunin (1814-1876) that the French syndicalists
inherited their "over-powering hatred of the centralized state, a sharp
distrust of politicians, and a rudimentary conception of workers'
control in industry." Imbued with strong anarchist tendencies, many of
these unions came to regard the State with hostile eyes and to reject
the conquest of political power. The general strike, comprising workers
in all trade unions, rather than political parties, was to be the
primary means of achieving the social revolution.</p>

<p> Many anarchists participated in syndicalist unions, and in
fact it was their participation which largely prevented these unions
from becoming subsidiary to the political parties in their respective
countries. There was a clear distinction between parliamentary
socialism and anarcho-syndicalism. The anarchists believed that the
State could never become an instrument of emancipation even in the
hands of a socialist government. These anarchists denounced
parliamentary action as a "pellmell of compromise, of corruption, of
charlatanism and of absurdities, which does no constructive work." On
the other hand, most European socialists called for the workingman to
participate in parliamentary life. They didn't think that political
abstention was helpful or possible. The anarcho-syndicalists responded
that "Politics can never be the way of emancipation for the workers.
... You can change the form of political state, ..., but it will still
be coercive."</p>

<p> There was always a danger of these anarchist unions being
co-opted by political parties, socialist or Marxist. In 1907, a leading
Italian anarchist, Errico Malatesta, (whose life and ideas will be
examined in greater detail) cautioned anarchists "against entering
unions infested with socialist politicians, lest they lose sight of the
ultimate goal of a classless society. Fearful that syndicalism would
sink into the morass of trade-unionist reformism and 'bureaucratism',
Malatesta warned his anarchist comrades not to become union officials."
The distrust of parliamentary methods, particularly by the French
syndicalists, was reinforced by the sell-outs performed by their top
leaders. Many French anarcho-syndicalists felt that they were sold out
when in 1899, Alexander Millerand accepted the post of Minister of
Commerce.</p>

<p> This anti-political bias was the confirmed policy of nearly
all the syndicalist unions all over Europe. Syndicalism was best known
for its advocacy of direct action and the general strike. Workmen were
warned against even accepting beneficial labor legislation since they
would be reinforcing a power they wanted to destroy. Labor reform could
only be obtained independently of parliamentarism.</p>

<p>             <b>The Italian Debate</b></p>

<p> From their very beginning, anarchists had argued that
parliamentary activity by socialists would corrupt their principles,
and that socialists in bourgeoisie legislatures could not sincerely and
effectively work for the abolition of the State. In Italy, where
Bakunin had spawned an active anarchist movement, there were echoes of
this dispute for many decades. Much of the Italian working class was
reluctant to participate in any kind of disciplined party activity and
was against any kind of parliamentary life, for the very reasons cited
by the anarchists. Workers elected to office soon became renegades to
their cause.</p>

<p> These ideas and the defense of the anarchist abstentionist
position were promoted by all of the prominent Italian anarchists
during the last decade of the 19th Century. One of them, Luigi
Galleani, in his recently translated The End of Anarchism?, wrote:
</p><blockquote>The anarchists' electoral abstentionism implies not
only a conception that is opposed to the principle of representation
(which is totally rejected by anarchism), it implies above all an
absolute lack of confidence in the State. And this distrust, which is
instinctive ... is for the anarchists the result of their historical
experience with the State and its function. ... Furthermore,
abstentionism has consequences which are much less superficial than the
inert apathy ascribed to it. It strips the State of the constitutional
fraud with which it presents itself to the gullible as the true
representative of the whole nation, and in so doing, exposes its
essential character as representative, procurer, and policeman of the
ruling classes.</blockquote>

<p> Galleani's book was written as a rebuttal to Saverio Merlino. At
one time a very prominent Italian anarchist and lawyer, Merlino became
dissatisfied with anarchism in the late 1890's, and moved closer and
closer to parliamentary socialism. He eventually became a politician
himself. Merlino's defection was a source of concern to those remaining
within the Italian anarchist movement and some of its leading
theoreticians, like Galleani and Errico Malatesta, engaged in long
polemical discussions in order to counter the effect of Merlino's
defection.</p>

<p> Merlino had been living outside Italy until 1894, and when he
returned to Naples he was arrested and imprisoned there to serve out an
old sentence. He was freed in late 1896 or early 1897, and soon
thereafter informed the conservative newspaper, Il Messaggero, that his
political opinions had changed. This provoked a debate with Errico
Malatesta, which continued until 1898, when Malatesta was arrested.
Merlino concluded that he no longer considered himself an anarchist,
and would rather define himself as a 'libertarian socialist'.</p>

<p> Furthermore, he now approved of parliamentary action, so much
so, that, in agreement with other friends, he proposed to present
Galleani (who was then also confined as a political prisoner) as a
candidate for Parliament on the Socialist Party ticket as a protest
against political detention and as a means to set him free by popular
request. Galleani refused the offer. He and other anarchist prisoners
published a special newspaper, in which they rejected the use of
electoral means, even as a way of freeing themselves. As anarchists
they wished to assert, "once and for all their firm refusal to
compromise, or in any way distort their opposition to the State - a
fundamental tenet of their convictions." The front page of their paper
carried an editorial, signed by Galleani, titled, "The faith remains
unshaken". The hostages were determined to save the dignity of their
principles and would rather remain in the squalor of their jails or
their islands of confinement, at peace with themselves, "than return to
the so-called free world by bowing down to their jailers - whom they
despised with concessions they knew to be false and shameful."</p>

<p> The debate between Merlino and Malatesta received wide-spread
attention both in Italy and abroad. Emma Goldman summarized it years
later when she stated her position that anarchists should not cooperate
with communists in elections. She wrote to Alexander Berkman, that
</p><blockquote>You probably remember the controversy between
Malatesta and Merlino. Of course fascism wasn't known then. But black
reaction was. And it was Merlino who argued that anarchists by joining
the socialists during elections would help defeat the reactionary gang.
I don't know whether you remember Malatesta's reply. It was to the
effect that the anarchists would, as they had always done, merely get
the chestnuts out of the fire for the socialists and liberals. And they
would injure their ideas beyond repair.</blockquote>
<p> Merlino's basic thesis was that the struggle for liberty must be
fought on all fronts, including electoral politics. Although he
recognized that anarchists do not aspire to political power, he did not
consider it contrary to their principles to participate in electoral
struggles against reactionary regimes. It was better to support a
republican or socialist candidate than a conservative one who was
likely to impose martial law. Merlino looked with disfavor on the
anarchist abstentionist position because he thought it had brought
about two negative results: 1) the separation of the abstentionist
anarchists from the most active and militant part of the populace; and
2) their abstention served to weaken them in front of the government.</p>

<p> In practice, Merlino saw nothing contrary to anarchist
principles in the electoral struggle. He did refuse, however, to
condone anarchists serving as ministers in the government. This did not
preclude the election of deputies to parliament, who would probably
always remain in the minority. Their election would be a method of
popular agitation against a reactionary government; it would be their
duty to speak out against the existing government, denouncing its
arbitrariness. Finally Merlino conceded, that although parliamentary
methods, as all things of this world, had their draw backs, it was a
perfectly valid method of agitation and propaganda, suitable to be used
by anarchists.</p>

<p> Malatesta bitterly opposed Merlino's ideas. One of his main
themes was that by getting people accustomed to voting and delegating
authority they are made powerless in handling their own communal
affairs. Since anarchists don't aspire to power, there was no motive
for them to assist those who do. Both Galleani and Malatesta rejected
the use of protest candidates because they took away the unity of the
struggle which constituted the characteristic opposition of anarchism
to politics. For Malatesta, the essence of parliamentarism was that
parliaments can make and impose laws. Contrary to Merlino, Malatesta
thought that all anarchists had to fight this idea, as anarchists do
not grant to others the ability to bind them. As Malatesta stated,
"Parliamentarism is a form of government and government means
legislative power, judicial and executive powers; it means violence and
coercion, and the imposition of force and the will of the governors on
the governed." Thus it must always and firmly be rejected by
anarchists.</p>

<p> Malatesta also argued that even if anarchists could win at
electoral politics they would still not want to hold positions of
power. "We are against the principle of government and we do not
believe that participating in it is the way to renounce power."
Furthermore, he recognized that abstentionism, although a question of
tactics, was integrally related to the question of anarchist
principles. "When one renounces it [abstentionism] one ends with
renouncing also the principles involved. And that happens because of
the natural connection between means and ends." Finally he argued that
instead of legitimizing parliamentary government, anarchists should
stand for its abolition. He wrote:

</p><blockquote>Our mission, as anarchists, instead is
            showing to the people that parliamentary government,
            although it is the least bad of the types of government, is
            still a government. THE REMEDY WILL NOT BE IN CHANGING THE
            FORM OF GOVERNMENT BUT IN ABOLISHING IT.</blockquote>
<p> The Merlino-Malatesta debate foreshadowed the problems that 20th
Century anarchists were to encounter in their efforts at political
collaboration. We will find this true both in the case of the Russian
and Spanish anarchists which will now be examined.</p>

<p>             <b>Anarchists And The Russian Revolution</b></p>

<p> The historian, Paul Avrich has noted that the anarchists in
Russia had always set themselves apart from other radical groups by
their "implacable opposition to the state in any form. Faithfully they
cleaved to Bakunin's dictum that every government, no matter who
controls it, is an instrument of oppression. Nor did they exclude the
'dictatorship of the proletariat' from this indictment, ..." Years
before Bakunin had predicted the anarchists' differences with Marx,
when he had written in Statehood and Anarchy that the dictatorship of
the proletariat would be "the most autocratic, the most despotic, the
most arrogant, and the most contemptuous of all regimes." Though the
anarchists desired, along with Lenin, to destroy the Provisional
Government, Bakunin's warnings about the power hungry communists
lingered in their minds.</p>

<p> When the Czar abdicated in mid-March, 1917, a Provisional
Government was set up under Prince Lvov, who was superseded by
Alexander Kerensky in July. When Kropotkin returned to Russia that
summer, he was well received by the masses and the government. Kerensky
offered the well-known libertarian a cabinet post as Minister of
Education as well as a state pension, both of which Kropotkin declined.
Kerensky certainly had had in mind capitalizing on the popularity of
Kropotkin if he could.</p>

<p> Much to the dismay of the anarchists, the downfall of the Czar
fell far short of their principal objective, which was the social
revolution and abolition of the Russian government. Although the
February revolution had overthrown the monarchy, it failed to eliminate
the State. Some anarchists compared the February rising to a game of
musical chairs, in which one ruler took the seat of another. Thus the
immediate aims of both the Bolsheviks and the anarchists came to
coincide since both desired the elimination of the Provisional
Government. As the noted historian of this era, Paul Avrich, has
written, this "was all they shared in common, however. Collaboration on
this end, ultimately resulted in the destruction of anarchism in
Russia."</p>

<p> Kerensky's Provisional Government had elections scheduled for
October, and as the time drew near for the Constituent Assembly to be
selected, "anarchist spokesmen poured forth a veritable torrent of
invective on the subject of representative government." Alexander
Shapiro, whom we shall meet again in Spain, wrote that "no parliament
can break the path toward liberty, that the good society can be
realized only through 'the abolition of all power' ... Bill Shatov,
another Russian emigre anarchist, declared that political power in any
shape ... was not worth a rotten egg" and that "political power can
give us nothing."</p>

<p> When Lenin seized power in the November 1917 coup, he was
readily assisted by the anarchists. The latter blindly hoped that no
new government would take the place of the Provisional one.
"Disregarding the preachments of Bakunin and Kropotkin against
political 'coups', they had taken part in a seizure of power in the
belief that power, once captured, could somehow be diffused and
eliminated." With the establishment of the Bolshevik government, they
found that it was impossible to eliminate political power by capturing
it. This ... marriage of convenience" (as Paul Avrich termed it),
between the anarchists and Lenin, lasted only as long as Lenin wanted
it to. Lenin had used the anarchists to his own advantage and when he
was finished with them, there was nothing more to do than to eliminate
them, since they were truly a threat to the Communist Party.</p>

<p> The antagonism between the Soviets and the anarchists was
further heightened when Lenin opened peace talks at Brest-Litovsk in
the Spring of 1918. Many anarchists had become so disillusioned with
Lenin, that they sought a complete break with him. The Bolsheviks, for
their part, began to contemplate the suppression of their former
allies, who had outlived their usefulness. A contemporary anarchist
critique of Bolshevik power argued that it had offered abundant proof
that "state power possessed inalienable characteristics; it can change
its label, its theory, and its servitors, but in essence it merely
remains power and despotism in new forms."</p>

<p> Finally in April 1918, armed violence broke out between the
Bolsheviks and anarchists when the government conducted a raid against
26 anarchist centers in Moscow. A dozen Cheka agents were slaughtered,
about 40 anarchists were killed or wounded, and more than 500 were
taken prisoner. Practically all the anarchist presses and periodicals
were closed down and shortly afterwards, the Cheka conducted similar
raids in Petrograd and the provinces.</p>

<p> The anarchists reacted by accusing the Bolsheviks of having
acted as "Judases" and betrayers. They also turned to violence to
defend themselves and counter-attack. Anarchist groups bombed the
office of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party while it was in
session during 1919. Shortly before the bombing they had described the
Bolshevik dictatorship as the worst tyranny in human history. The
violence was denounced by most prominent anarchist leaders, but
nevertheless the Soviet government used this violence as an excuse to
make massive new arrests from anarchist ranks. "Bolshevik spokesmen
maintained that with the survival of the revolution at stake, it was
imperative to snuff out violent opposition from every quarter. No
anarchists, they insisted, were being arrested for their beliefs, but
only for their criminal deeds."</p>

<p> Paul Avrich has written that, "The deepening of the Civil War
of 1918-1921 threw the anarchists into a quandary over whether to
assist the Bolsheviks in their internecine with the Whites. Ardent
libertarians, the anarchists found the repressive policies of the
Soviet government utterly reprehensible; yet the prospect of a White
victory seemed even worse." The anarchists realized that by refusing to
come to the assistance of the Bolsheviks, they might help tip the
scales in favor of the Whites. The anarchists were split apart by this
issue opinions ranged all across the spectrum; from eager collaboration
with the Communist Party to active, violent resistance against them.
Some anarchists even became Communist Party members. In the end, a
great many gave varying degrees of support to the regime. Nevertheless
there there were a few anarchist stalwarts and die-hards who had utmost
contempt for their renegade colleagues. They contemptuously labeled
them "Soviet anarchists" and claimed they had succumbed to the
blandishments of politics. "Again and again, they warned that political
power is evil, that it corrupts all who wield it, that government of
any kind stifles the revolutionary spirit of the people and robs them
of their freedom."</p>

<p> Lenin was impressed with the support provided by some of his
"Soviet anarchists" and in 1919, he commented that many anarchists were
becoming dedicated supporters of Soviet power. Bill Shatov was an
outstanding example. Shatov, whose comments against political power we
read earlier, served Lenin's government as a military officer during
1919 (he took on a significant part of organizing the defense of
Petrograd) and then as Minister of Transport in the Far Eastern
Republic in 1920. Several years later he was sent to the East to
supervise the construction of the Turk-Sib Railroad. (Perhaps it was
poetic justice that Shatov was exiled to Siberia and was believed to
have been shot during the purges of the late 1930's.) Shatov justified
his participation in the government by citing the danger of a
reactionary takeover. Nevertheless, he admitted to Emma Goldman and
Alexander Berkman, after their arrival in Russia in January 1920, that
"the Communist State in action is exactly what we anarchists have
always claimed it would be - a tightly centralized power still more
strengthened by the dangers of Revolution."</p>

<p> When Kropotkin died in February 1921, his funeral represented
the last great anarchist gathering in Russia. Certain important
anarchist political prisoners were released from Cheka prisons for the
day and public support for the deceased "anarchist prince" was
overwhelming. However, the following month, March 1921 witnessed the
climax of the Soviet atrocities against the anarchists. The sailors and
civilian population of Kronstadt, an island base in the Gulf of
Finland, revolted against the Soviets. The rebels were suppressed by
the Red Army, under the direction of Trotsky. Following the climax of
the revolt, new raids against the anarchists swept the country. Few
anarchists were left at large, their book stores were closed, and even
the followers of the pacifist Tolstoy were imprisoned or banished. A
number of pacifists had already been shot during the Civil War for
refusing to serve in the Red Army.</p>

<p> It was at this time that Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman and
other foreign-born anarchists were in Russia, hoping to witness the
revolution in practice. Their expectations were sorely disappointed.
Emma Goldman threatened to stage a personal protest in order to call to
Lenin's attention the persecution of the anarchists in Russia. Many of
them were already in jail (where they had participated in at least one
prolonged hunger strike) and many others had been shot. Finally the
Soviets granted amnesty to many of the better known anarchist prisoners
who had no record of violent opposition to the Soviet government. These
freed prisoners had to leave the country at once. Meanwhile, "Emma
Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and Sanya [Alexander] Schapiro, profoundly
disheartened by the turn the revolution had taken, had made up their
minds to emigrate also."</p>

<p>            <b>Emma Goldman: On Revolution And Elections</b></p>

<p> Goldman and Berkman had been in Russia for nearly two years
(January 1920 to December 1921) and had seen the revolution in action.
Emma Goldman's reaction to that experience was recorded in her two
books, My Disillusionment in Russia and in My Further Disillusionment
in Russia. By the time of her departure from Russia she had become
highly critical of Lenin and his regime. She knew that power corrupts
anarchists and communists, just as it corrupted their opponents. Her
outlook on social revolution had been refined as a result of her
experiences. No longer did she look upon the violent destruction of an
existing regime and the social revolution as synonymous. The failure of
the Russian Revolution was that it took superficial political changes
(the replacement of the Czar by Lenin) for an indication of systemic
change. Nothing could have been further from the truth. As Emma Goldman
wrote,
</p><blockquote>[In] its mad passion for power, the
            Communist State even sought to strengthen and deepen the
            very ideas and conceptions which the Revolution had come to
            destroy. ... With the concept that the Revolution was only a
            means of securing political power, it was inevitable that
            all revolutionary values should be subordinated to the needs
            of the Socialist State; indeed exploited to further the
            security of the newly acquired governmental power.</blockquote>
<p>             The perversion of the revolution was
            crystallized for Emma Goldman by the "all-dominating slogan"
            of the Communist Party: "THE END JUSTIFIES ALL MEANS."
In a brilliant analysis of means and ends, Goldman asserted that,
</p><blockquote>There is no greater fallacy than the
            belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods
            and tactics are another. This conception is a potent menace
            to social regeneration. All human experience teaches that
            means cannot be separated from the ultimate aims. The means
            employed become, through individual habit and social
            practice, part and parcel of the final purpose; they modify
            it, and presently the aims and means, become identical. From
            the day of my arrival in Russia I felt it, at first vaguely,
            then ever more consciously and clearly. ... The whole
            history of man is continuous proof of the maxim that to
            divest one's methods of ethical concepts means to sink into
            the depths of utter demoralization. In that lies the tragedy
            of the Bolshevik philosophy as applied to the Russian
            Revolution.</blockquote>
<p> One of her final comments on her Russian experience was summed up
in 1936, at the time of the Stalinist purges, when she claimed that the
anarchist criticism of Russia had been vindicated. "Our position," she
wrote, "as regards power and dictatorship has been strengthened by the
events in Russia." All the people being purged began their lives with
an ideal for which they suffered prison and exile. "No sooner did they
ascend to power than their past was wiped out and they became as savage
in their persecution of their opponents as the enemies they came to
destroy." She concluded, "For nothing so corrupts and disintegrates as
power itself." The whole essence of the question about Russia was for
her the fact that "you cannot educate men for liberty by making them
slaves," and this is what the Bolsheviks had tried to do.</p>

<p> During the mid-1930's Emma Goldman was concerned not only with
the direction of events in Stalinist Russia but also with the direction
taken by the anarchist movement in Spain. She was to some extent
intimately connected with the events in Spain, because of her contacts
in the international anarchist movement, as well as her two visits to
Spain during the Civil War. Evidence of her concern is found in her
correspondence and published articles, particularly in her discussion
of "anarchists and elections". In an article by this title appearing in
the June-July 1936 Vanguard, she proposed and answered the following
questions:
</p><blockquote>1. [The] question as to whether the
            abstention from participation in elections is for Anarchists
            a matter of principle? I certainly think it is, and should
            be for all anarchists.
<br>2. ... [It] is but logical for
            Anarchists not to consider political participation as a
            "simple question of tactics." Such tactics are not only
            incompatible with Anarchist thought and principles, but they
            also injure the stand of Anarchism as the one and only true
            revolutionary philosophy.
<br>3. Can Anarchists, without scruple, and
            in the face of certain circumstances exercise power during a
            transition period? ... I cannot understand how they can
            possibly aspire to power.</blockquote>
<p> For Emma Goldman, it was "not the abuse of power" which corrupted
everybody, but rather "the thing itself, namely power which is evil and
which takes the very spirit and revolutionary fighting strength out of
everybody who wields it." Collaboration and cooperation in elections
and with the Communists (as the anarchists were doing in Spain) did not
meet with her approval. </p><blockquote>I cannot agree with the suggestion that anarchists
should in grave times co-operate with communists in elections. ... I
myself consider it not only inconsistent with our views of vesting
power to politicians by means of voting for them. I also consider it
highly dangerous. We insist, do we not, ... that the means must
harmonize as far as possible with the end. And our end being anarchism,
I do not see how we can very well unite with any political party. ...
(With our past experience with socialists and communists, it seems
folly to join them. But more important is my firm belief that we would
be spitting ourselves in the face, if we approved participation in
elections. Fighting ALL POWER AND ALL GOVERNMENT AS WE DO, how can we
help by putting anyone into positions of power? ... WE SIMPLY CANNOT
AND SHOULD NOT MAKE THE PLUNGE. ... We can only state our own position
towards the fundamentals of anarchism. And that has always been
opposition to the slick political machine that has ever corrupted the
best of people or has paralyzed their efforts.</blockquote>

<p>             <b>Anarchists and the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939)</b></p>

<p> Though Emma Goldman aided the Spanish anarchist movement during
the Spanish Civil War, as her statements make clear, she disagreed with
their participation in the Republican government. However, she stood
behind them because they were fighting with their backs to the wall
against the whole world. Their struggle was her second chance to see
the revolution at last. She was in Spain from September 1936 until
January 1937, at which time she went to London to help publicize the
republican cause. She was continually embroiled in disputes over
anarchist principles and their collaboration in Spain. Her appointment
as a collector of relief funds for the Catalan government somehow
seemed to show her complicity, however much she denied it. She was
sickened by the farcical comedy of anarchist leaders defending
government property, which occurred in the aftermath of the May crisis
in Barcelona. She agreed with her former companion in Russia, Alexander
Shapiro, who complained that "Anarchists in government will and 'must'
act like all government officials and ministers."</p>

<p> The important point about the Spanish Civil War is that for
the first and only time in modern political history there were
anarchist ministers serving in both provincial and federal cabinets.
Nothing like this had ever transpired in anarchist history. The Spanish
anarchists had caused a terrible breach among both their international
comrades and their principles. It is important to understand what
motivated the Spaniards into holding office and participating in
governments, and what, if any lessons, are to be learned from their
experiences.</p>

<p> The anarchist tradition in Spain has a long and rich history,
mostly embroidered with violence and terrorism. By the first two
decades of the 20th Century, the anarchist presence in Spain was a
significant element, particularly among the working classes and their
syndical trade unions. The CNT (Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo or
National Confederation of Labor) had been founded in 1910 and was a
national trade union. The influence of the anarchists saved it on
various occasions from falling into the hands of other political
organizations. In 1927, the anarchists founded their own trade union,
the FAI (Federacion Anarquista Iberica or Anarchist Federation of
Iberia) in an effort to radicalize their own movement. It was hoped
that the FAI would act as a "radical" watchdog to correct the
deviationist tendencies present within the CNT.</p>

<p> The CNT and FAI shunned parliamentary activity and in contrast
to other labor parties, held no seats in the central or local
government and refrained from nominating candidates for parliament.
They followed a syndicalist line, believing that direct action and
strikes were necessary to accomplish the social revolution. The FAI,
the more radical organization of the two, made no distinction between
governments of the right or the left, just as they made no distinction
between individual politicians. For them, all politicians were equally
bad.</p>

<p> Post-World War I Spain had suffered a series of military coups
and rebellions and experienced continual struggle against the monarchy.
In December 1931, a new constitution was adopted after the dissolution
of the royal throne. The Republican government of Azana was hard
pressed by discontent, especially in the autonomous province of
Catalan, which was granted home rule in late 1932. In early 1933, there
was a large uprising in Barcelona, sparked by anarchist and syndicalist
unrest with the progress of social reform. In November of that year the
first regular elections for the Cortes were held.</p>

<p> The anarcho-syndicalists generally took a hard line,
abstentionist approach to this election. Both the CNT and FAI had urged
their members not to vote. Tierra y Libertad (Land and Liberty)
declared a month before the elections in November: "Our revolution is
not made in Parliament, but in the streets." "We are not interested in
changing governments," Isaac Puente, an influential anarcho-
syndicalist, had written at the same time: "What we want is to suppress
them. ... Whatever side wins, whether the right or the left will be our
enemy, ... and will have at its disposal the truncheons of the assault
guards." A few days before the election, Tierra y Libertad
editorialized:
</p><blockquote>Workers! Do not vote! The vote is a
            negation of your personality. Turn your backs on those who
            ask you to vote for them. They are your enemies. ... As far
            as we are concerned they are all the same; all politicians
            are our enemies whether they be Republicans, monarchists,
            Communists, or Socialists. ... Parliament ... is a filthy
            house of prostitution toying with the interests of the
            country and the people.</blockquote>

<p> The November 1933 election for the Cortes resulted in giving the
Parties of the Right 44% of the seats. Throughout 1934 and 1935, social
and political unrest continued to plague Spain. Catalan sovereignty was
proclaimed and its independence suppressed by military efforts. Finally
in January 1936, the Cortes was dissolved and new elections were called
for February. These elections were lukewarmly endorsed by many Spanish
anarchists, after the Popular Front coalition promised to free all
political prisoners. It was largely the support of the anarchists and
syndicalists which enabled the Popular Front to come to power. This
combination of Republicans, Socialists, Syndicalists, Communists and
anarchists won a decisive victory over their political opponents.</p>

<p> The new Popular Front government which took power proclaimed
an amnesty as it had promised, but soon faced the Civil War, which
broke out on July 18, 1936, as the result of a rebellion by military
chiefs in Morocco. The Popular Front government held its own in Madrid
and Barcelona but the nationalist forces made advances in other parts
of the country. Catalan, which had already previously regained
autonomous status, immediately sought anarchist participation in the
existing provincial government, the Generalitat.</p>

<p> The CNT had its largest following in Catalan and it was
logical that the existing provincial government would want to take
advantage of its presence. Luis Companys, President of the Generalitat,
summoned representatives of the CNT-FAI to his office as soon as the
uprising had been defeated (July 20, 1936) in order to obtain anarchist
and syndicalist legitimization of his rule. Garcia Oliver and Diego
Abad de Santillan became ministers in the government of the Catalan
Generalitat. Santillan saw no other choice than for anarchists to share
the administrative power with the Companys government in Catalan.
Paralysis of the federal government in Madrid and continued advances by
the nationalist forces threatened to envelop Spain in fascism. It was
up to the anarchists to transform the militia committee of Catalan into
a truly revolutionary body. Regarding his experience as a minister in
the Catalan government, Santillan, in 1938, wrote: "Simply as governors
we [the anarchists] were no better than anyone else, and we have
already proved that our intervention in governments served only to
reinforce governmentalism."</p>

<p> Meanwhile, the rebel, nationalist forces had made further
advances into Republican Spain and on September 4, 1936, the Popular
Front formed a new government under the leadership of Largo Caballero,
a former socialist minister. If the Caballero government was to be more
than a government in name, it would have to "assume control of all the
elements of state power. ... The work of reconstructing state power
could not be achieved or at least would be extremely difficult to
achieve without the participation in the government of the extreme wing
of the libertarian movement, ..." This part of the movement was
represented by the anarchist oriented CNT and FAI.</p>

<p> Although views differed, most of Caballero's colleagues
advised his seeking the participation of the libertarians in the
government. The advantages of having them share the responsibility for
its measures would be indubitable. "The entry of representatives of the
CNT into the present Council of Ministers would certainly endow the
directive organ of the nation with fresh energy and authority," wrote
Claridad, one of Largo Caballero's journals on October 25, 1936,
especially "in view of the fact that a considerable segment of the
working class, now absent from its deliberations, would feel bound by
its measures and authority." What Caballero's advisers could not guess
was whether or not the anarcho-syndicalists would wish to become
ministers in the government and share in the reconstruction of the
State. This was questionable even though quite recently they had
violated their principles by joining the Catalan regional government.
Furthermore, Largo Caballero had tried, when forming his cabinet in
September 1936, to secure the participation of the anarcho-syndicalists
by offering them a single ministerial seat without portfolio. Burnett
Bolloten has noted that, Caballero "needed their participation in the
belief that they would feel themselves bound by his government measures
and authority." However at that time, they rejected his offer based on
their traditional anti-governmental stand and their personal distrust.
(Caballero had been responsible for persecution of anarchists, earlier
in his political career.)</p>

<p> The CNT had not been ready to enter the Madrid government in
September but in October 1936 a plenary session of the regional
federations of the CNT was held for the purpose of discussing the
matter further. The result was that the CNT authorized its
representatives to "conduct negotiations for bringing the CNT into the
government." The CNT justified its position by stating: "... in order
to win the war and to save our people and the world, it is ready to
collaborate with any one in a directive organ, whether this organ be
called a council or a government." In their negotiations with
Caballero, the CNT representatives asked for five ministries including
war and finance, but he rejected their demand. Finally, on November 3,
(1936), they accepted four: justice, industry, commerce, and health,
none of which, however, was vital. Furthermore, the portfolios of
industry and commerce had previously been held by one minister. The
four CNT members named to the government were: Juan Garcia Oliver
(justice), Juan Lopez (commerce), Federica Montseny (health and public
assistance), and Juan Peiro (industry).</p>

<p> As we have seen, Caballero was partly motivated by his desire
to invest his government with greater authority. President Azana, who
had to sign the decrees appointing the anarchist ministers, was
hesitant to do so. Caballero claimed that Azana did not see the
significance of getting the anarchists into office. "From terrorism and
direct action, it [Spanish anarchism] had moved to collaboration and to
sharing the responsibilities of power. ... It was a unique event in the
world and would not be sterile. I [Caballero] told him [Azana] that if
he did not sign the decrees, I would resign."</p>

<p> The Communists also had a similar, ulterior motive in drawing
the anarchists into the government. They hoped to bolster their own
power. The Communists were concerned with world opinion, particularly
in France, Britain, and America. They wished to give an appearance of
legality to the Spanish Republic. Thus they hoped that the
participation of the anarcho-syndicalists in the government would
placate foreign opinion and enhance their prospects of receiving
military assistance from these Western powers. Furthermore, after the
war, it was revealed that the Communists hoped to create a breach in
the ranks of the anarchists and syndicalists by drawing the CNT into
government collaboration.</p>

<p> In fact, there was a discord in the ranks of the anarchists
and syndicalists because nearly everyone was unhappy with what they
recognized to be a compromise. Their justification was simply that if
the anarchists did not take a role in the Republican government, a
dictatorship worse than Russia would result and that trip prospects of
a fascist regime were more unacceptable to them than the act of
collaboration with the existing government.</p>

<p> Reluctant criticism, both within Spain and outside Spain, was
immediately forthcoming from anarchists. Emma Goldman, who had argued
with Federica Montseny for hours against collaboration, "believed that
the anarchists had abandoned political principle to save Spain from
further foreign intervention. Such a course was not surprising in the
context of Spanish history, but the real tragedy of the anarchists was
that they were pulled further and further into the mire of compromise."
The December 1936 Vanguard carried remarks on the Spanish situation,
translated from a French anarchist journal. The author, Luigi Bertoni,
wrote, partly in justification and partly in recognition of the
anarchists departure from principle.
</p><blockquote>The present Spanish government does,
            indeed, differ considerably from any ordinary government;
            that is especially evident from the hostility shown towards
            it on the part of governments all over the world. But it is
            still essentially and practically a government, and must
            therefore contain to a considerable extent the faults
            inherent in it. Thus it is not without apprehension that I
            view the discharging of ministerial functions on the part of
            our four comrades, despite the complete confidence we have
            in them. ... Rather than 'governmental anarchists', I should
            call them 'revolutionary anarchists'.</blockquote>
<p> Another outspoken critic of anarchist collaboration was Camillo
Berneri, an Italian anarchist living in Barcelona. Robert Kern, a
historian of this era, has noted that beginning October 1936, Berneri
wrote "vitriolic articles in his Guerra Di Classes demanding, among
other things, development of an international revolutionary campaign as
the prime defense of the republic. He also attacked the mood of
anarchist collaboration. Difficulties in Aragon did not necessitate a
total capitulation to the Communists. Membership in the Popular Front
cabinet, far from solving anything, would only put anarchists under
extreme coercion to maintain unanimity in Madrid. All differences of
ideology would eventually be extinguished and Stalinist statism imposed
- a tragic end to a long anarchist tradition." Before Berneri was
assassinated in 1937 (for his anticommunist attacks), he wrote an "Open
Letter to Federica Montseny" in which he claimed that the acceptance of
the ministerial posts had no direct bearing on the war effort or upon
the problems that the anarchists hoped to solve by joining the cabinet.
In his open letter Berneri asked, "The hour has come to enquire whether
the Anarchists are in the Government for the purpose of being the
vestals to serve as a Phrygian Cap for some of the politicians flirting
with the enemy or with the forces anxious to restore 'The Republic of
all Classes'."</p>

<p> Federica Montseny, one of the four who had accepted
ministerial positions in the Madrid government of Caballero, was one of
their most outspoken defenders. She and her family represented several
generations of radical anarchist activism in Spain. </p><p> Federica was born in 1905, the daughter of Federico Urales,
who was one of the most well-respected anarchist theoreticians and
journalists in Spain during the first two decades of the century. In
the early 1920's, she and her father renewed publication of a famous
anarchist journal, La Revista Blanca. Federica was editor of the
journal and an author of many novels. By the Fall of 1936, she was one
of the most popular anarchist leaders and theoreticians in Spain. At
the age of 31, she accepted the ministerial post for health and public
assistance, becoming the first woman ever to hold a ministerial office
in a Spanish national government.</p>

<p> There is little doubt that Montseny was a purist, at least in
principle. In a 1934 article in La Revista Blanca, she wrote that all
governments are evil: "It became obvious that no theory justified the
existence of any state. Be it socialist, communistic, democratic, or
fascistic, they were all the same - they were states. Each kind of
state possessed the same purpose: the promotion of friends, the
suppression of the workers by keeping them submissive, and the
exploitation of the many by the few." A state in all places and at all
times represented "oppression and the annihilation of man. ... [A state
was] incarnated in armed organisms which sustain through the method of
terror and force, the Power which dominates, robs, and which kills."</p>

<p> As her biographer adds, "Montseny insisted" that her view of
the State applied not only to traditional governments, but to
revolutionary ones as well. So it is clear that Montseny understood
that ALL governments were evil even though she became a minister in
one.</p>

<p> The underlying justification for her action was that she saw
the Nationalists as a greater threat to anarchist ideals than any
liberal republican government. She felt it foolish to allow oneself to
be drowned by the tide of fascism. The retrograde nature of fascism
demanded a new approach. Anarchists were among the first to realize
that the struggle against fascism was of utmost importance. In a 1937
talk, she said, "We think [by cooperating with Caballero] we will avoid
a repetition of the fate of the anarchist movements in other countries
where Communists assumed direction of the revolution."</p>

<p> It was not without trepidation that she entered the government
in November 1936. In a speech she made in France in 1945, she
reportedly said of her doubts about becoming a governmental minister:
"I asked for twenty-four hours to think over the matter. I consulted my
father who, thoughtfully, said, 'You know what this means. In fact it
is the liquidation of anarchism and of the CNT. Once in power you will
not rid yourselves of power.' ..." After she resigned from the cabinet
in mid-1937, she declared: "As a daughter of veteran anarchists, ... I
regarded my entry into the government, my acceptance of the post to
which the CNT had assigned me, as having more significance than the
mere appointment of a minister. ... What inhibitions, what doubts, what
anguish I had personally to overcome in order to accept the post! ...
[For] me it implied a break with my life's work, with a whole past
linked to the ideals of my parents. It meant a tremendous effort, an
effort made at the cost of many tears." She also noted that the
complicity of anarchists in government would, as she put it, "ruin many
of us morally." Its safe to conclude that ultimately she regretted her
departure from principle and her involvement in the government. She had
not accomplished anything lasting by her efforts.</p>

<p> The Caballero government managed to sustain itself in power
until May 1937, at which time it was succeeded by that of Negrin which
excluded the anarcho-syndicalists from participation. The four
anarchist ministers had done little to strengthen the position of the
anarchist movement during their time in office and had irreparably
injured anarchist ideas. This realization burst upon the libertarian
movement in 1938, as Franco came nearer and nearer to total victory.</p>

<p> During the last two weeks of October 1938, national plenary
meetings of the regional federations of the libertarian movement were
held in Barcelona. Three major divisions of opinion were to be found
among those present. A majority held that the libertarian movement
should participate in politics, as they had already done. Two minority
views existed: 1) that the FAI should be converted into a political
party of the CNT and attempt to represent the libertarian movement in
the government once again, and 2) the view, represented rather feebly
by the Young Libertarians of Catalan, "that all participation in
government should be renounced." During one of the sessions of the
Young Libertarians, their views came across rather picturesquely. "To
try to join the State in order to destroy it is like taking your wives
and sisters to brothels in order to abolish prostitution."</p>

<p> The result of the plenary meetings were resolutions in favor
of political participation. One resolution read: "Our direct
participation in the administrative bodies of political, economic, and
military life ... was motivated by our high sense of responsibility and
the need for co-operation in the fight against fascism ... in order to
facilitate a victory. ... [This participation] has not been a
correction of our tactics but rather an intelligent addition to our
methods in accord with the circumstances and in response to an abnormal
situation in the life of the people." However, in an effort to purify
their intentions, another resolution read: "The Libertarian Movement,
having taken part in politics in violation of its tradition, declares:
the political Power, the State, will always be the antithesis of
Anarchism, and [our] circumstancial participation in Power has been ...
for the purpose of opposing to the greatest possible extent, from a
position in Power and from everywhere else, the strangulation of the
revolution."</p>

<p> Many historians agree that the collaboration of the CNT and
FAI in the republican government failed to improve the military
situation during the their time in power. Vernon Richards, another
historian of this era, concluded that "it certainly added prestige to
the Government." In his opinion, there is little question that the
anarchists were "out-witted and outmaneuvered by the politicians on
every issue. Equally significant is that their contact with politicians
had no ideological influence on the politicians whereas a number of
leading members of the CNT were in the end won over to the very
principles of government and centralize authority, ..." They became
victims of the false belief that "power was only evil when in the
'wrong hands', and for a 'wrong cause', and not that 'power tends to
corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely', ..."</p>

<p> If we had measured the number of anarchists in Spain by their
refusal to collaborate in electoral politics, then we would probably
have found very few of them there. Moreover, it seems that few of them
understood the implications of their philosophy, which was not only
anti-electoral but anti-war. One of the most basic contradictions faced
by the Spanish anarchists was the fact, as John Brademas put it, that
they "sought to make war and social revolution at the same time." This
was impossible in theory and contradictory in practice. The choice
between fighting the forces of Franco, on the one hand, and fighting
for the revolution, on the other hand, seemed to be answered by
violence, no matter which way they turned. Before the Civil War broke
out, there had been interest (by some Spanish anarchists) in the ideas
of the French anarchist, Sebastien Faure, who was strongly
anti-nationalist and anti-militaristic. Faure's non-violence ...
attracted Spaniards fighting a military dictatorship. Faure believed
that organizing masses of everyday people into a Gandhi-like campaign
of public non-violence would render military power useless." However,
Faure's ideas were not followed up and here lies at least part of the
real tragedy of Spanish anarchism.</p>

<p> The Spaniards did not see the incongruity of trying to wage
war on the basis of anarchist principles. War and anarchism are simply
repugnant; one is destruction and extermination, and the other is
mutualistic voluntaryism. The anarcho-militias, manned by anarchists
during the Civil War, were full of problems, for the simple reason that
the individual anarchist soldier refused to recognize any authority. He
took a dim outlook on rank, military titles, and regimentation. As one
anarchist commentator on the Civil War noted, "War has always been a
tomb, never a means of revolution."</p>

<p> The ultimate problem of violence and social revolution facing
the Spanish anarchists was that an anarchist society could not be
established and maintained on the basis of coercion. Recourse to
violence was always an indication of weakness not strength. The
revolution with the greatest possibility of success would be the one
which was brought about peacefully. Only then would there be any valid
sign of unanimity among the population on the objectives of the
revolution.</p>

<p> One of the chief justifications of the Spanish anarchist
participation in government and war was that they were choosing the
lesser of two evils. During the events leading up to the elections of
February 1936, Diego Abad de Santillan observed this very thing, that:
</p><blockquote>"participation in the elections was advisable.
            We gave power to the leftists, convinced that under the
            circumstances they were the lesser evil."</blockquote>

<p>             In an astute analysis of this justification, Murray Bookchin observed:
</p><blockquote>This could be construed as a reasonable
            and honest statement if action based on the "lesser evil"
            was seen for what it really was - a distinct departure from
            principle, openly admitted to be such, a bitter pill to be
            swallowed to deal with an acute illness. ... But after this
            has been said, one must emphasize that it would have been
            preposterous to expect a "lesser evil" to behave with a
            noble virtue. ... The best the CNT and FAI could have hoped
            for from the newly elected state would have been neutrality;
            to base one iota of their  policy on active state support
            was not only absurd, but marked the initial steps toward the
            "politicalization" of the Spanish anarchist  movement and
            its eventual conversion into a political party. ... The
            Anarchists ... were slowly becoming clients of the creature
            they most professed to oppose: the state power itself. ...
            Having taken to the vote, they began to take to politics.</blockquote>
<p>             <b>Concluding Remarks</b></p>

<p> This review of the European anarchist tradition has offered
many reasons for the rejection of electoral participation and political
power by voluntaryists today. Malatesta was the best spokesman for the
non-electoral anarchists, having defended that position against
Merlino, as early as 1897. Malatesta saw not only the dangers of
electoral politics, but he foresaw the dangers of war and revolutionary
violence years before they developed in Spain. In 1930, regarding
anarchism and revolutions, he wrote:
</p><blockquote>I incline to the view that the
            complete triumph of anarchy will come by evolution,
            gradually rather than by violent revolution. ... In any
            case, if we take into account our sparse numbers and the
            prevalent attitudes among the masses, and if we do not wish
            to confuse our wishes with the reality, we must expect that
            the next revolution will not be an anarchist one, and
            therefore what is more pressing, is to think of what we can
            and must do in a revolution in which we will be a relatively
            small and badly armed minority. ... But we must, however,
            beware of ourselves becoming less anarchist because the
            masses are not ready for anarchy. If they want a government,
            it is unlikely that we will be able to prevent a new
            government being formed, but this is no reason for our not
            trying to persuade people that government is useless and
            harmful or of preventing the government from also imposing
            on us and others like us who don't want it. ...  If we are
            unable to prevent the constitution of a new government, if
            we are unable to destroy it immediately, we should in either case
            refuse to support it in any shape or form. Disobedience on principle,
            resistance to the bitter end against every imposition by the
            authorities, and an absolute refusal to accept any position of command.
             ... In this way we shall not achieve anarchy, which cannot be imposed
            against the wishes of the people, but at least we shall be preparing
            the way for it.</blockquote>
<p>            And again in 1932, he wrote:
</p><blockquote>The primary concern of every government is to ensure
its continuance in power, irrespective of the men who form it. If they
are bad, they want to remain in power in order to enrich themselves and
to satisfy their lust for authority; and if they are honest and sincere
they believe that it is their duty to remain in power for the people.
... The anarchists ... could never, even if they were strong enough,
form a government without contradicting themselves and repudiating
their entire doctrine; and, should they do so, it would be no different
from any other government; perhaps it would even be worse.</blockquote>
<p> Wherever and whenever anarchists have engaged in war and/or
electoral politics they have inevitably failed both militarily and
politically. One cannot remain an anarchist and take part in war or
government. By compromising one's anarchism this way, one does not make
failure less certain; only more humiliating. That is the lesson of
anarchist history.</p>
