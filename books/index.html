  <a name='tmtyg'></a><font color="#C60000">New!</font> <i>A Matter of No Curiosity</i> by Albert Jay Nock (2010)
<br><?php priceAt2(19,'No Curiosity'); ?> postpaid.<br>
 Evidence of the State is all around us. It is here when we are born; and it is here when we die. To most people its institutional existence is a matter of little or no curiosity, but to Albert Jay Nock, who wrote OUR ENEMY THE STATE,  it was a problem of huge magnitude. This small volume of 139 pages contains some of his best essays explaining why we should  concern ourselves with its origins, legitimacy, and anti-social nature.<br/>

  <a name='tmtyg'></a><font color="#C60000">New!</font> <i>Take Me to Your Government: Four Fables</i>
<br><?php priceAt2(13,'Take Me'); ?> postpaid.<br>
 This highly recommended 160 page anthology comprises the previously published
 stories of Princess Navina’s visits to Malvolia - where the king‘s one principle
 is to make everyone as unhappy as possible (1991), Mandaat - where all human
 actions must be authorized by the government (1994), Nueva Malvolia - where
 rulers seek the unhappiness of their subjects (1999), and Voluntaria - where
 there is no coercive government (2002). “Like Jonathan Swift’s <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>
 they raise provocative questions about modern governance by transporting us to
 imaginary countries,” and like <i>Gulliver</i>, <i>Princess Navina</i> is bound to become a classic
 in which voluntaryism outshines all other modes of human interaction.<br/>

   <i>National Identification Systems: Essays in Opposition</i><br />
  Edited by Carl Watner with Wendy McElroy; 308 pages, paperback.<br />
  &quot;This is more than a book about national ID. It
is about all forms of government enumeration, from
the census of antiquity, to government naming practices,
fingerprinting, social security numbers, and
drivers licenses, to cutting-edge biometric technologies
such as DNA, iris scans, or subcutaneous microchips
capable of allowing those in charge to know where we
are twenty-four hours a day via global positioning
satellites. This book looks at the big picture of national
ID: what it is, how it has developed, and how it might
potentially change our society. It is also about those
who have chosen to resist or oppose national ID schemes -
from Gandhi's satyagraha campaign in South Africa in
1906 to those Americans who refuse to be counted or
carry a government number. These &quot;Essays in Opposition&quot;
are intended to honor those whose consciences and
principles do not allow them to &quot;roll over&quot; and acquiesce. ...<br />
    &quot;Never before has there been a book devoted to the idea
[of proving] that the logical outcome of government
involvement in these areas (from government birth
certificates to governmental databases and surveillance)
is a 1984-style population control. That is why national ID
systems have been called a 'trademark of totalitarianism'.&quot;<br />
