<b><font size="3" color="red">Click <a href="/taxation/taxationisslavery.html">HERE</a> to read the Introduction to
<i>Render Not</i></font></b><br><br>
 <b>Statement of Purpose:</b> In his "Introduction" to this anthology, Carl Watner argues that "taxation is no better
than slavery." Government taxation is a coercive activity that introduces force and violence into otherwise peaceful
relationships. That is the primary reason why voluntaryists  oppose taxation.  Some goods and services are essential
to human survival, but voluntaryists realize that they need not be provided by the government on a coercive basis.
What we oppose is the coercion involved in collecting taxes. We oppose the means and take the position that the ends
never justify the means. Our opposition to taxation doesn't concern itself with whether too much money is being
collected, or whether that money is being spent wastefully. Rather, the focus is on the fact that any amount of money
forcefully collected is stealing. It is no more proper for government agents to seize property than it is for you to
rob your neighbor at gunpoint, even if you spend the money on something that you think will benefit your neighbor.
Majority rule cannot legitimize slavery or taxation. As R. C. Hoiles, founder of the Freedom Newspapers, was always
keen to point out, there is only one standard of right and wrong, and that standard applies to the lone individual,
to members of a group, and to the employees of the State.  <br><br>
