  <font color="#C60000">New!</font> <i>National Identification Systems: Essays in Opposition</i><br />
  Edited by Carl Watner with Wendy McElroy; 308 pages, paperback.<br />
  &quot;This is more than a book about national ID. It
is about all forms of government enumeration, from
the census of antiquity, to government naming practices,
fingerprinting, social security numbers, and
drivers licenses, to cutting-edge biometric technologies
such as DNA, iris scans, or subcutaneous microchips
capable of allowing those in charge to know where we
are twenty-four hours a day via global positioning
satellites. This book looks at the big picture of national
ID: what it is, how it has developed, and how it might
potentially change our society. It is also about those
who have chosen to resist or oppose national ID schemes -
from Gandhi's satyagraha campaign in South Africa in
1906 to those Americans who refuse to be counted or
carry a government number. These &quot;Essays in Opposition&quot;
are intended to honor those whose consciences and
principles do not allow them to &quot;roll over&quot; and acquiesce. ...<br />
    &quot;Never before has there been a book devoted to the idea
[of proving] that the logical outcome of government
involvement in these areas (from government birth
certificates to governmental databases and surveillance)
is a 1984-style population control. That is why national ID
systems have been called a 'trademark of totalitarianism'.&quot;<br />

  by Jim Payne
  Princess Navina has spent her young life studying foreign governments, but in Voluntaria she draws a blank. The people of Voluntaria have sworn off using force to manage society. As a result, they have none of the political fixtures of the modern world: no taxation, no regulation, no laws ... and no lawyers!<br>
  How do they solve the problems of daily life without depending on politicians?<br>
