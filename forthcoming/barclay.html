<p><font size="5" face="New Century Schlbk"><b><center>Comments on Anarchy and
Modern Society</center></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">By Harold
Barclay</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">After
my book, CULTURE: THE HUMAN WAY (1982), I prepared another which I entitled
PEOPLE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT: AN ANTHROPOLOGY OF ANARCHY. Here I briefly
described some of the numerous different societies around the world
which thrive without any state or government. It was an attempt to demonstrate
that anarchy was neither chaos nor an utterly utopian dream. I pointed
out that in one respect--that is, the absence of government--all humans
were anarchists ten thousand years ago. Anarchy has, it seems, worked
in small face-to-face communities, although some ethnic groups such
as the Nuer or Dinka numbering hundreds of thousands have maintained
anarchic type polities. Where it really requires testing is in the context
of concentrated and large populations. The book did not stress the absence
of anarchy in urban, modern style societies. The only example of anarchy
in a modern society is during a short period in the Spanish Civil War
when anarchists did organize an urban society, but, unfortunately, it
suffered under war conditions and was soon ended by the combined efforts
of the Communists and Fascists. I later discussed the problem of &quot;Anarchism
and Cities&quot; in a book, CULTURE AND ANARCHISM.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">I
would not agree with those who say that the examples of anarchy among
the small scale societies that I described in PEOPLE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT
have no relevance to modern industrially oriented and heavily populated
communities. The very idea of the face-to-face interaction characteristic
of small groups is directly applicable and of major importance to the
functioning of large scale societies. The greatest solidarity, personal
satisfaction, and dedication to the group is maintained by the direct
and equal participation in decision making regarding the substantial
issues confronting any community. The Tonga of southern Africa provide
yet another example. They are a matrilineal society of several hundred
thousand people who were primarily gardeners. They had no centralized
political system and were an anarchic society in which each individual
was obligated to several different cross cutting groups, which in turn
were part of a network of further obligations so that any negative action
against an individual or group resulting from one set of relationships
had its counter restraining effect resulting from affiliation with other
groups and individuals. One&#39;s obligation to the network of groups to
which he was a member acted as a device to maintain mutual aid and social
control. No chiefs or police acted to impose and force &quot;proper&quot;
behavior.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">A
characteristic of functioning anarchic societies is the technique for
conflict resolution where the aim is primarily directed at reestablishing
or maintaining group harmony rather than seeking to determine guilt
and impose vengeance motivated punishment. Thus, in a conflict between
groups an independent, uninvolved mediator agreed upon by both parties
is chosen to consider the matter. Before proceeding, however, he will
require the opposing parties to agree to his decision and he will then
first attempt to bring a compromise agreement between them. Failing
this he will decide the case. He is a mediator, not an arbitrator, meaning
that he has no police power to enforce his decision. Agreeing to his
decision is considered a moral obligation on the part of those involved.
Another not dissimilar technique for dealing with conflict and wrong
doing is provided by the traditional practice of some American Indian
groups in their healing circles. I would highly recommend Rupert Ross,
RETURNING TO THE TEACHINGS, EXPLORING ABORIGINAL JUSTICE (1996, Penguin
Books) for details on this approach.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">In
anarchic polities as well one important feature concerning conflict
is psychological. That is, in several such societies considerable emphasis
is placed on anger control. It is imperative to restrain one&#39;s temper.
In addition it is to be noted that the greatest number of casualties
and worst kind of human conflict is warfare which is carried to its
supreme climax by the state. During the twentieth century over one hundred
million people lost their lives as a consequence of wars conducted by
the several nation states. Stateless or governmentless societies lack
the means and the motivation for conducting such mass killing.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Consensus
is the primary mode for making decisions in an anarchic society. Matters
of major policy require unanimity of consent or acquiescence - a sense
of the meeting. Strongly dissenting factions are permitted to withdraw
from the larger group. Thus, every effort is made to protect &quot;minority&quot;
rights without jeopardizing those of the majority. Obviously, in a highly
heterogeneous population such consensus would be difficult or impossible
to achieve. Some have therefore suggested that consensus be reserved
for matters of general principle while practical application could be
dealt with by majority vote while still reserving the right of withdrawal.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">As
I have observed earlier in this essay in an anarchic society there is
a heavy emphasis upon personal responsibility. One does not have access
to the state among other things to provision the group. Today in the
modern state an individual spends 30-40% of his working hours to support,
in the form of taxes, governments which proceed to spend these funds
on large military establishments, top heavy bureaucracies, ludicrous
frills for state administrators, bribery and corruption. In an anarchist
society one would direct his energies to participating in the management
of cooperative enterprises dedicated to the maintenance of the community.
Productive enterprise, whether industrial or agricultural, would be
administered by those responsible for it--that is, those who produce
the goods. Necessary activities such as fire protection, road maintenance,
water supply, medical attention or what have you would be matters of
group responsibility. The several enterprises would be federated with
other similar groups to provide regional oversight and service. Power
would be retained at the local level and would be minimal at the upper
confederated level.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">In
most of the simpler societies property as individually owned material
things are generally limited to movable items. Communal ownership of
land, the chief resource, is the ordinary practice. There are many anarchists
who advocate communal ownership of all land, industrial capital, and
natural resources which raises a serious question of how this is to
be achieved. Perhaps anarchists are not adhering to their principles
if they seek to expropriate all land, industry and resources by compelling
on the threat of violence a minority to submit and surrender what they
see as their wealth. At the same time it might be possible to achieve
such a goal if the community at large were to ostracize those who did
not conform. I should prefer to see an arrangement which allows for
both individual and communal ownership but where no one exploits others.
That is, individual ownership would therefore be limited to small businesses
employing only owner operators or partners.</font></p>
<p align="justify">      <font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">...
There are a couple of other points ... concerning the anarchist society
which should be mentioned. First, a point I have made before but deserves
repetition: the ground work for any such society must be laid in the
education of the youth and the radical reeducation of the mass of adults
all in the direction of an emphasis upon mutual aid, cooperation, personal
responsibility and techniques of peace. Given the propensities and training
of most people today any large scale anarchist society would never work.
Particularly important is the need to develop a devotion to non-violence
for there can be nothing more socially disruptive than violence and
this is especially true of anarchic polities. Secondly, at least a quasi-anarchist
way of life can be pursued within the existing system. One may ignore
and avoid government and the state as much as possible. One may join
with others in cooperative societies for all sorts of purposes; mutual
aid amongst neighbors can all be developed within the existing order.
The Amish and Hutterites, for example, thrive through all their lives
within a large society of outsiders and maintain their own local community
managed mutual aid system which has little or no dependence on outsiders
[or] the state. Perhaps, as Gustav Landauer observed, if enough people
avoided the state and looked to other social relationships, the state
itself might be undermined.</font></p>
