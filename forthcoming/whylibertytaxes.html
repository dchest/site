Why Voluntaryism and Liberty Don't Depend on Taxes or Government
</h2> <br></p>

By Carl Watner</font></center> <br></p>


<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">    Seldom does one
find a book that embraces statism to the hilt, but THE COST OF RIGHTS
(New York: W. W. Norton: 1999), by Stephen Holmes and Cass R. Sunstein,
is one such. From its subtitle, Why Liberty Depends on Taxes,
to the assertion in the second paragraph of the dust jacket, that our
rights to property, speech and religion ... would not exist if government
could not collect taxes to codify, protect, and enforce them, we
find the authors turning liberty upon its head, making us slaves of
the state, and our ownership of property dependent upon the legislature.
Let us first offer a few definitions and then let our authors speak
for themselves.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     As I have
previously explained in my articles about Freedom As Self-Control,
freedom is an attitude of mind, a spiritual quality which cannot be
conquered by iron jail bars or even death. Freedom is an inner spirit
which allows each person to seek and speak the truth to the best of
their ability. Freedom is bulletproof in the sense that one cannot shoot
a truth. One's body may be shot, but that does not affect the validity
of one's ideas. Liberty is a condition of not being molested by other
human beings, either in one's own body or in one's rightfully owned
property. In other words, each person has rights as an individual, that
do not depend on their place of birth or the privileges granted to them
by the political system within which they live. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     Holmes and
Sunstein might not dispute these assertions, but they completely ignore
the possibility that rights might be protected by entities other than
coercive governments. They define rights as <i>important interests
that can be reliably protected by individuals or groups using the instrumentalities
of government.</i> [p. 16, italics in original] To our authors, individual
rights and freedoms depend fundamentally on vigorous state action.
[p. 14] Personal liberty ... presupposes social cooperation managed
by government officials. [p. 15] Without government ... there
would be no right to use, enjoy, destroy, or dispose of the things we
own. [p. 59] Property rights exist because possession and use
are created and regulated by law. [p. 60] As Daniel Klein put it
in his analysis, Holmes and Sunstein hold that all things are owned,
fundamentally and ultimately by the government. ˜Private property
[is] a creation of state action, [and] ˜laws [enable property owners]
to acquire and hold what is ˜theirs'. [pp. 66, 230]</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 1</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Holmes and Sunstein never defend the implication of their definition,
that all rights stem from the government. Nor do they ever explain why
and how governments have the right to protect us.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 2</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     The reason
that Holmes and Sunstein say that government depends on taxes is because
governments require money to exist. Without money to pay soldiers, police,
judicial officials, office workers, and other bureaucratic employees,
governments would not be able to provide the services they now perform
for their citizens. Fire protection, police, the army, the courts all
require paid personnel, equipment, buildings, and roads to access these
facilities. In short, these things cost money. Since governments are
not charities, they do not solicit voluntary contributions. Since governments
are not competitive businesses, they do not charge for their services.
Instead, governments get their funds via taxation: the compulsory collection
of revenue from their citizens. How much governments collect is not
limited by what its competition charges (since the government will permit
no one to compete with it, there is no competition), but simply by how
much robbery the public will stand for before its members refuse to
pay or revolt, or both.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
But the truth is Holmes and Sunstein miss their mark. Most people desire
some sort of professional protection from thieves, fires, and access
to some type of professional dispute resolution service. Holmes and
Sunstein never ask the most important question: Is it necessary that
these services be provided by a coercive and monopolistic government?
The answer is, No, and there are clear historical cases - when
and where governments were not present to provide these services - that
we find such services being provided on a competitive and voluntary
basis. Such services do not depend on the existence of governments,
but rather on the need, desire, and willingness of consumers to pay
for them (on a competitive market, where they are not monopolized or
prohibited by a coercive government). In American history, this has
happened innumerable times. Both travelers going west on the Overland
Trail and people in California during the early days of the Gold Rush,
had no government to provide basic public services. Does this mean they
had no right to their property or  that anarchy and chaos ensued?
Surely not. Listen to one contemporary observer of the Gold Rush:</font></p>
<blockquote><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first consequence
of the unprecedented rush of emigration from all parts of the world
into the country almost unknown, and but half reclaimed from its original
barbarism, was to render all law virtually null, ... . From the beginning,
a state of things little short of anarchy might have been reasonably
awaited.</font></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
Instead of this, a disposition to maintain order and secure the rights
of all, was shown throughout the mining districts. In the absence of
all law or available protection, the people met and adopted rules for
their mutual security - rules adapted to their situation, where they
neither had guards nor prisons, and where the slightest license given
to crime or trespass of any kind would inevitably lead to terrible disorders.
...</font></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">
In all the large diggings, which had been worked for some time, there
were established regulations, which were faithfully observed. ... When
a new placer or gulch was discovered, the first thing done was to elect
officers and extend the area of order. The result was that in a district
five hundred miles long, and inhabited by 100,000 people, who had neither
government, regular laws, rules, military protection, nor even locks
or bolts, and a great part of whom possessed wealth enough to tempt
the vicious and depraved, there was as much security to life and property
as in any part of the Union, and as small a proportion of crime.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">3</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font> <br>
</p></blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At other times, on the American
western frontier, the federal government could not adequately maintain
a circulating currency. So businessmen set up their own mints and began
providing coined money that effectively competed with government coinage.
The point is that while the western frontier may have been stateless,
due to the absence of the federal government and its employees, it was
not lawless. Property on the western frontier existed despite the fact
that state and federal governments were not there to enforce their statutory
laws. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     The fact
of the matter is that Holmes and Sunstein have it all backwards. If
there were no property, there would be nothing for the parasitic state
to expropriate. If members of civil society did not work and produce,
what would there be for the members of the state apparatus to confiscate?
There can be no thievery if there is nothing to steal, and there can
be nothing to steal if something is not first produced. As Carroll Quigley
observed, when public authority in the Western world disappeared around
900 A.D., society continued. ... It was discovered that man can live
without a state; ... . It was discovered that economic life, religious
life, law, and private property can all exist and function effectively
without a state.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">4</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Or as John Zane put it in THE STORY
OF LAW: Nothing is more silly than to say that the law made private
property. The fact is the exact opposite. Private property came to exist
[independently of the state] and it made the law.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">5</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     Government
protection (alleged) of property rights is one of those political myths
which governments use quite effectively to legitimize their conquest
over us. In reality, government can only negate property rights, not
protect them. This is true for a number of reasons, both theoretical
and historical. First of all, governments have historically derived
their revenues from taxation. This necessarily violates the rights of
those who would not voluntarily support them. If those people do not
willingly surrender their property, which is demanded by the government
in the form of taxes, then government agents will ultimately either
seize their property or imprison them for refusal to pay. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     Secondly,
all governments presume to establish a compulsory monopoly of defense
(police, courts, law) services over a given geographical area. Individual
property owners who do not wish to be included are protected nonetheless.
If they resist the enforcement of government laws, they will eventually
be jailed for obstruction of governmental administration of justice,
or killed for resisting armed government officers. Furthermore, as commentators
such as Murray Rothbard, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, and Walter Block have noted,
the idea that the state can provide any sort of legitimate protection
is inherently contradictory. How can government protect us by stealing
from us? Governments do not protect our property from  thieves;
instead governments steal our property under the guise of taxation and
call it protecting us. Or as Hans-Hermann Hoppe put it, A tax-funded
protection agency is a contradiction in terms.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">6</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     In the
last paragraph of their book, Holmes and Sunstein write that only
through government can a complex modern society achieve the degree of
social cooperation necessary to attain the liberty of the individual.
[p. 232] I whole heartedly disagree with their statement. The history
of voluntaryism in America, and other parts of the world, proves them
wrong. From the evolution of the English language, to the establishment
of time zones, to the standardization of railroad track guages, to the
establishment of industrial standards, to the evolution of private mediation
and arbitration, voluntaryism has shown itself capable of creating vibrant
communities. Social cooperation does not depend on government compulsion,
nor does co-operation happen at the point of the government's gun.
It occurs when people interact for mutual benefit. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     Another
example of world-wide voluntary co-operation is the credit card industry.
Credit card associations, such as Visa, Mastercard, and Discover make
it possible for cardholders to use their charge cards almost anywhere.
Yet as Edward Stringham has pointed out government did not create this
system. No one is forced to use a credit card, nor is anyone harmed
by not using one.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">7</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The difficult problem of verifying the
credit worthiness of individual customers is solved by their use of
a reputable credit card. If debit and credit cards can operate all over
the world, in the absence of a single unified world government, what
other services might exist if their was no government to inhibit their
creation? </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">     To Holmes
and Sunstein I say, yes: rights have costs; but governments have even
greater costs and drawbacks. Give us, the members of society, a choice.
Let us spend our money, freely, as we choose! My guess is that very
little money would go to coercive government. As soon as people realized
they could get more bang for the buck from the competition, government
as we know it would become bankrupt. Voluntaryism and liberty depend
on respect for individual rights and free choice, not on coercive government
and taxes. Pay your money, and make your choice: Which would you rather
have? </font></p>
