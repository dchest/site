<h2>Last Statement Before the Court</h2>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 By Kurt Huber <br><br>
</p>
</center>


<p>


<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[&quot;Kurt Huber, born October
24, 1893, in Chur, Switzerland, had been a professor at the University
of Munich from 1926 on. It was impossible for this inspired and fascinating
teacher to hide his deep antipathy to National Socialism. He became
the central figure and counsellor of the [White Rose] student group
that agitated for resistance by means of pamphleteering. After the incident
of February 18, 1943, when Hans and Sophie Scholl dropped pamphlets
into the main lobby of the university, the Gestapo stepped in. Huber
was condemned to death on April 20. Meditation and prayer filled his
time as he waited for the execution of the sentence, which followed
on July 13.&quot;]</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     As
a German citizen, as a German university professor, and as a political
being, I consider it not only my right, but my moral duty to collaborate
in the shaping of German history, to uncover evident abuses, and to
combat these. ... My purpose has been to rouse student circles - not
through an organization, but by means of simple words - not to any act
of violence but to a moral discernment of existing grave evils in political
life. A return to clear moral principles, to a constitutional state,
to mutual trust among men - this is not an illegal aim; on the contrary,
it means a restoration of legality.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     I
have asked myself, taking the point of view of Kant&#39;s categorical imperative,
what would happen if this personal principle motivating my actions were
to become a universal law. To this there is only one possible answer:
it would mean a return of order, security, and trust into our political
life. All morally responsible people would raise their voices in unison
with us against the threatening domination of might over right, of purely
arbitrary will over the will of morality. The tenet that upholds the
right of even the smallest ethnic group to self-determination has been
forcibly suppresssed [sic] throughout Europe, and no less so the tenet
looking to the preservation of racial and cultural individuality. The
tenets fundamental to genuine national solidarity have been annihilated
by the systematic destruction of the trust between one man and another.
There is no more terrible judgment on a national community than the
admission, which all of us must make, that no man can feel safe in the
presence of his neighbor, that a father can no longer feel safe in the
presence of his son.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     That
was what I wanted, that was what compelled me.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     There
is an ultimate boundary beyond which all external legality becomes false
and immoral - namely, when it becomes the cloak of cowardice, of a lack
of courage to take action against notorious breaches of justice. A state
that strangles all free expression of opinion and that brands any morally
justified criticism, any suggestion for betterment, as a &quot;preliminary
to high treason,&quot; subject to the severest penalties, breaks an
unwritten law that has always been alive in &quot;sound and popular
understanding&quot; and must remain alive.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     I
have attained this one goal: I am presenting this warning and admonition
not to a small private discussion group but before the most responsible,
the highest judiciary seat. Upon this admonition, this solemn plea for
a return, I am staking my life. I demand that freedom be given back
to our German nation. We do not want to eke out our brief existence
in the chains of slavery, even though they might be the golden chains
of a material abundance.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     You
have taken from me the status and the rights of a professor, as well
was my doctorate attained <i>summa cum laude</i>, and placed me on a
footing with the lowest criminal. No trial for high treason can rob
me of the dignity of a university professor, of a man who openly and
courageously avows his view of the world and the state. The inexorable
course of history will vindicate my actions and my purposes; on this
I rely with adamant faith. I hope in God&#39;s name that the spiritual forces
that will vindicate them may be born in good time from my own nation.
I have acted as I had to act in response to an inward voice. I accept
the consequences in the spirit of the words of Johann Gottlieb Fichte:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">                              <WBR>                             <i>
And you must act as though</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>                              <WBR>
On you and on your deeds alone</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>                              <WBR>
The fate of German history hung,</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>                              <WBR>
And the responsibility - your own.</i></font> <br></p>
