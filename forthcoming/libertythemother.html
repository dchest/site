<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Nobody,
not even those in the government, knows what is going to happen in life.
People are not automatons. There <i>is</i> a certain regularity to life;
the earth revolves on its axis such that the sun &quot;rises&quot; every
morning and &quot;sets&quot; every evening, but neither my life nor
yours repeats itself exactly as the day before.  I can leave my
place of businesses wondering whether we will have work to do the next
day. When I return the following morning, before we even open, people
appear: one needs chicken feed, another horse feed;  two have cars
that need repair; one wants a transmission flush; another needs four
new tires. All this unscheduled work appears overnight. People&#39;s desires
change; babies are born; people die; there are new inventions; people
have accidents; people make new discoveries (they have a flat tire,
they have run out of feed). If one were a government planner, one could
either react to this with amazement and wonderment or disgust. Should
people have the liberty to do what <i>they</i> want with their bodies
and property or should there be some central institution that tells
them what to do and <i>controls</i> all this activity? Does private
property provide us with a means to a peaceful and prosperous world?
Or should things be &quot;dictated&quot; by the State and its directives?
Is liberty the mother of order in our human societies? As Wendell Berry
once wrote, is the &quot;attempt at total control ... an invitation
to disorder [and disaster]&quot; or just what humans need?*</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Butler
Shaffer in his new (2009) book, BOUNDARIES OF ORDER: Private Property
as a Social System, argues that “individual liberty and social order
are obverse sides of the same coin.” (xiii) A harmonious society can
only come about if people are not coerced  by thieves, muggers,
murderers, gang members, or government agents, who in the process of
exercising violence force people to do what they would not otherwise
choose to do. In other words, voluntary exchanges take place only because
both parties expect to benefit. The spontaneous actions of millions
of individuals aim at nothing less than the improvement in their well-being.
But people can only act if they have property to act with. They must
use <i>their </i>bodies in some specific space (even if they do nothing
but think with <i>their </i>mind, they are <i>somewhere</i>). That is
why private property constitutes a social system, and why such a system
brings about higher standards of living. People are not always successful,
but in the vast majority of exchanges they do better themselves.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     The
underlying theme of his book, as Shaffer describes it, is “that our
traditional institutional model [of government] is not only no longer
useful to, but actually destructive of, the purposes for which we have
long embraced it. This book will suggest and explore an alternative
model for the peaceful and productive conduct of society.” (25) This
paradigm is based “on the principle of the private ownership of property;
that freedom is possible only when private ownership claims are respected;&quot;
and that the very “existence of political systems” means that private
property has been violated. (xiii) Using private property as a yardstick
three critical questions need be answered in any social conflict - 1)
Whose property is it? 2) Who has aggressed? and 3) Who has been aggressed
against? With a slightly different twist, one can determine the amount
of government aggression in society by asking - how much of a criminal
does one become by minding one’s own business; and to what extent
do government employees confiscate property? In short, if you can ignore
the government, by using your own property as you choose, and if the
government does not put you in jail or seize your property for failure
to pay your taxes, then you’re probably facing an institution that
possesses little coercive power.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     One
of the recurring observations throughout this book is that regardless
of “[w]hatever system of ownership is in place, <i>someone </i>
will exercise decisional authority over property.” (6) Whether one
is living under Hitler’s national socialism, Stalin’s communism,
Britain’s fabianism, or American democracy every political system
must answer the question: “how are decisions to be made in the world,
and who will make them?” (9) The reason for this is the &quot;need
of all living things to occupy space and ingest energy.” (133) “Each
of us must be able to exclude others from the use and consumption of
resources necessary for our survival.”  (123) In other words,
private property &quot;is at the core of&quot; our humanness and &quot;our
well-being.&quot; (133) We must own ourselves and then the property
that we require for survival. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     A
perfect example of how a collectivist system must answer the question
&quot;who decides on the use of scarce resources&quot; is found in a
short scene from Nien Cheng’s LIFE AND DEATH IN SHANGHAI (pp. 406-407
in the 1988 edition). The author, after having been imprisoned for six
years, was released and wanted to have a brick wall constructed in order
to create a small bedroom in her hallway. In order to do so, she had
to bribe the driver of an electrical utility truck to help transport
the bricks. In answer to the author’s query as to whether this was
legal, and whether or not the mileage and gas consumption of the truck
was checked, the driver answered</font> <br></p>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">“Don’t forget,
in a socialist state, everything belongs to the people. You and I are
part of the people.”  ...  </font></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   “Well
to tell you the truth, I feel uneasy about using this truck, for my
private purposes. I don’t really think it’s right.”</font></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   “We
have public ownership in China. Right? Who is the public? We are. Right?”</font> <br>
</p></blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">So despite the long-standing
claim of collective ownership in a communist society, the driver of
the truck decided who could make use of it as a tool of transport. <i>
Someone</i> has to decide, whether it is an individual, or a committee,
or a politician, or a policeman. The idea that there can be societal-wide <i>
collective</i> ownership is a propaganda myth. Furthermore, as Shaffer
points out, the ultimate test of ownership comes down to this: “who
can decide, without getting the permission of another, to <i>destroy </i>
[...]his property?” (171) The truck driver could not decide whether
or not to destroy the <i>people&#39;s </i>
 truck, nor could the utility manager. Ultimately, Mao Zedong or someone
or some group of people within the Communist Party held that decision-making
power.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     As
in his earlier works, Shaffer refers to chaos and complexity theory,
and points out that  an orderly system may arise out of apparent
disorder. (65) “[T]he substance of social order is found in the regularities
that arise, spontaneously and without any intention to do so, from the
interplay of [voluntary] human behavior.&quot; (73) Three important
observations in this regard are: first, that each person’s capacity
to obtain accurate information on which to make decisions is limited;
second, that the further a person is from the actual source of knowledge,
the more likely there is room for error; and third, that &quot;when
we allow the [S]tate to make decisions for an entire population, we
run the risk of utter disaster should the&quot; decision be wrong. (44,
280) Decision-making by those who risk their own property not only localizes
the impact of wrong choices, but allows people everywhere the freedom
to copy those who succeed. (42,84)</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     THE
BOUNDARIES OF ORDER is the result of many decades of the author’s
thinking about the interrelatedness of social order and private property.
He clearly comes down on the side of voluntaryism, arguing &quot;that
liberty and order imply one another.&quot; (297) In other words, voluntaryism
comes about naturally if no one does anything to stop it. This book
is not for a budding, or even beginning, voluntaryist. It requires deep
concentration, patience, and assumes a basic familiarity with the concepts
of self-ownership and homesteading. Although Shaffer embraces the idea
that the first to claim and use an un-owned resource thereby becomes
its legitimate owner, he also recognizes that without the support of
one’s neighbors, one’s claim to ownership will never be respected.
As Rose Wilder Lane explained in THE DISCOVERY OF FREEDOM (pp. 109-110
in the 1943 edition), the protection of our property ultimately depends
upon human decency.</font> <br></p>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   The
only safeguards of property seem to have been possession of the property,
individual honesty, and public opinion.</font></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">   ...
[C]abins were never locked on the American frontier where there was
no law. The real protection of life and property, always and everywhere,
is the general recognition of the brotherhood of man. How much of the
time is any American within sight of a policeman? Our lives and our
property are protected by the way nearly everyone feels about another
person’s life and property. </font></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">    </font></p></blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">With that Butler Shaffer would
surely agree.</font> <br> <br> <br> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">*Numbers within parentheses
refer to Shaffer&#39;s book unless otherwise noted. The expression &quot;Liberty,
not the daughter, but the mother of order&quot; was attributed to Pierre-Joseph
Proudhon by Benjamin Tucker, who used it as the flag on his anarchist
paper, LIBERTY, for many years. The quote by Wendell Berry is attributed
(by James C. Scott in his book, SEEING LIKE A STATE [1998], p. 288),
to his book THE UNSETTLING OF AMERICA. </font></p>
