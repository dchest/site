<h2>A Moral Challenge</h2>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 By Carl Watner <br><br>

<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">I
have recently been having correspondence with my son about the morality
of government taxation, and it prompted this &quot;challenge.&quot;
I maintain that taxation is theft and contrary to the universally accepted
moral principles: thou shall not steal and thou shall not murder. While
these two principles are found in the Ten Commandments, they are also
embraced by people of non-Judeo-Christian belief. They form the basis
of every civilization because without them there can be no peaceful
social cooperation or voluntary exchanges between human beings.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Most
of the people I have spoken to over the years think that government
taxation is not theft because government is a necessary social institution.
The attainment of the common good requires taxes to support government.
Thus, those who evade paying their proper share or those who object
to how their tax money is spent (the pacifist - on war; the Catholic
- on abortion; the anarchist - in general) must be threatened with force
beforehand. If they refuse to pay they will ultimately have their property
confiscated and sold at auction or they will find themselves imprisoned
(either after a conviction for violating the tax laws or for contempt
of court [for refusing to obey a judge&#39;s orders to cooperate]). If they
violently refuse to cooperate with the marshals that come to take their
property or arrest them, they will be subdued or killed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">These
actions by government agents are &quot;stealing&quot; and/or &quot;killing&quot;
by any commonly accepted definition of those terms. Aren&#39;t government
employees doing the same thing as members of the criminal gang: taking
property or life without the owner&#39;s consent? As Murray Rothbard (FOR
A NEW LIBERTY, 1973, p. 55) once asked: Is there a way to define taxation
so as to morally differentiate it from robbery?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Furthermore,
consider the fact that there is a moral way to collect taxes (without
force or violence): Try rational argument and persuasion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">If
government is really as necessary as most people think, then it ought
to be quite simple to convince others to support it (or at least support
as much of it as they believe is necessary). Instead of threatening
people, educate them. Convince them. Demonstrate why they ought to contribute
to government. Threatening them with force is not a way to answer their
arguments against paying.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">If
those who refuse to pay taxes at all, or who selectively refuse to pay
part of their taxes (for whatever reason), cannot be convinced, then
they ought to be left alone. They ought not to be placed in jail or
stolen from. Deny them whatever government services they are not willing
to pay for.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">And,
if the supporters of government are still unable to collect enough in
taxes to support the amount of government they deem necessary, then
they ought to dig deeper into their own pockets. The fact that government
is a &quot;good cause&quot; is no justification for stealing from or
killing those who refuse to support it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">My
challenge to people of good will is to recognize the logic and morality
of my argument. The first step in universalizing the commandments against
stealing and killing is to admit that taxation is theft, even if one
cannot understand how government and society would function in the absence
of coercive tax collection.</font></p>
