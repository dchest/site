<h2>Moral Challenge II</h2>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 By Carl Watner <br><br>

<p>


<p align="justify"><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I am getting increasingly
frustrated (as I write this it is August 2007) because so very few seem
to comprehend my moral argument that taxation is theft. Even members
of my own family don't seem to get it.</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It appears to
me that there are two components to the argument that taxation is theft.</font><br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">First is the moral
argument: If you define theft as the taking of a person's property against
their will, it ought to be perfectly straightforwardÂ  to conclude
that unless taxes are voluntary, it must be theft when the government
collects taxes under penalty of imprisonment or confiscation of property.
It might be plausible to argue that taxes are theft, but that they require
an exemption from the general social prohibition against stealing. But
so far, no one I have argued with has explained why taxation is a morally
justified form of theft. They simply argue that taxes are not theft
because the government is owed the money. Government is owed the money
because it has provided some sort of protection service. Thus, when
the government coercively demands taxes from its citizens, it is simply
being reimbursed for the service it has provided.</font><br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Second
is the practical argument: Most people believe that if taxes were voluntary,
then government would shrivel up and die. If they are religious, they
argue that God couldn&#39;t have willed thievery. If they take a secular
view, they simply believe that government wouldn&#39;t have the money to
support itself. &quot;But government,&quot; they argue, &quot;is a necessary
component of human society.&quot; Since government &quot;must&quot;
have money to exist, its income (taxes) can&#39;t be theft. </font><br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One
way I have tried to approach the general argument that &quot;taxation
is theft&quot; is to admit that human beings &quot;need&quot; protection
services, just as they &quot;need&quot; food, shelter and clothing.
The question that then must be answered is: How is that protection to
be provided In the case of food, shelter, and clothing we have ample
proof that the voluntary provision of these goods and services is possible.
Why must the provision of protection be an exception? </font><br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It
appears that most people cannot get past &quot;what is seen and
not seen.&quot; They &quot;see&quot; only what exists. They cannot even
begin to imagine the free market provision of protection services because
they have been indoctrinated by both Church and State to believe that
these services must be (and can only be) provided by a coercive, monopolistic
government. What they don&#39;t stop to think about is that if people weren&#39;t
forced to pay taxes, they (the people, the citizens) would have ample
funds to supply themselves with protection. If people were not coerced
into paying for government&#39;s high-priced and inefficient monopoly protection
they could turn to alternative sources of protection. I am sure that
variants of protection would come into being which we cannot even imagine
or dream of now. Witness all the other miracles of the free market.
Who could have dreamed of, a hundred years ago, all the ways electricity
is utilized today, or the advent of plastics, nylons, or computers.
Imagine what protection services might be offered if government was
not there to monopolize its production and stifle both invention and
competition. But really the practicality of the market provision of
protection is irrelevant to the moral question. Was plantation slavery
in the South justified because slaves were the only means of harvesting
cotton?</font><br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Many
people admit that much of what passes for taxation today is theft, but
they still cannot get past the idea that some amount of taxation is
&quot;just and proper.&quot; It reminds me of the argument for the &quot;just&quot;
price on the market. The only fair price is what a willing buyer and
seller agree on; and it is only fair at the time and place where they
decide to trade. The only possible way to determine a &quot;just&quot;
tax is in the same manner. How could government know how much protection
people &quot;need.?&quot; Let market purchasers of protection services
buy what services they want, at what prices they deem advantageous to
themselves. This is the only way to truly determine how much protection
we (as a society) should have. The only way to find out how much government
is necessary is to see how much government people are willing to pay
for - which means making their contributions to government voluntarily.
When people and citizens are ready to apply the general social prohibition
against stealing to the government itself, then we (as a society) will
have truly reached the realization that &quot;taxes are theft.&quot;</font><br>
