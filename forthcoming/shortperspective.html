<h2>A Short Perspective on Land and Social Evolution</h2>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">

<p>


<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">What
do we think about when thinking about &quot;land&quot;? The answer may
seem obvious. But it is not. In the early 18</font><font size="1" face="New Century Schlbk">th</font><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk"> century, when most people were
subsistence farmers, meeting most of their needs by their own efforts
and having little traffic with the then still rudimentary market process,
we thought of land as a tillable field or possibly a site for mining
various natural resources. It gained value as we built up or imported
richer soil or discovered minerals in it, and lost value as we exhausted
the soil or the minerals in it. The French Physiocrat economists of
the 18th century wrote of land as the source of all wealth. It was thought
of as physical, the solid part of the earth&#39;s surface and, as such,
necessarily limited in amount.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Then
the market process began to evolve rapidly and to an extent unprecedented
in human experience. By specializing their activity and exchanging products
and services, people found their wealth increasing exponentially. But
with specialization, land uses were no longer uniform. Instead of each
family tilling the soil much as their neighbors did, land uses became
increasingly diverse. Now it became important how a person located his
activities relative to other land uses. Each wanted proximity to his
specialized suppliers and markets, and so we had a booming growth in
cities, as people crowded in and jockeyed for the most strategic position
vis-a-vis others. Fertility of soil ceased to be a major consideration,
except for farmers. What mattered more was access to surrounding land
uses and natural features, which is to say, the unique environment to
which each site offered access. A French Physiocrat might have quipped
that &quot;three things give land its value: fertility, fertility, and
fertility.&quot; Today&#39;s realtor says, &quot;location, location, and
location.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">The
agriculturist envisioned land as some part of the solid surface of the
earth because that was his universe; it was where he dwelt; it was what
he knew. But a newer view, one more useful for economics, is that land
is not physical, nor is it limited to the earth. In this more technical
sense, &quot;land&quot; is intangible; it is simply a location in the
universe differentiated from all others by its three-dimensional position
in space. To be useful and hence to have value, it must be strategically
located for someone&#39;s purpose vis-a-vis human activities, present or
prospective. Hence the value of a particular parcel of land depends
on its <i>economic</i> <i>location</i>, which is to say its location
relative to human activities. That value is independent of any resource
or activity on the parcel, except as they might influence change in
surrounding activities and these then react back upon and affect the
original value. Economic location and, with it, land value, is ever
changing, continually being destroyed and created, constantly in flux
as individuals&#39; plans and activities change.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">So
now we are talking about &quot;land&quot; in two quite different senses,
the earliest having to do with the solid part of the earth&#39;s surface,
and the more recent reflecting the growing specialization of land usage
that for three centuries has developed apace with the evolving market
process. Failure to recognize this historic change can cause us grief.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk"><b>The &#39;Land
Question&#39;</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">John
Locke in the 17th century theorized that land, not being something that
anyone creates, since it is pre-existent, is not an appropriate subject
for property as most people conceive of that term.</font><font size="1" face="New Century Schlbk">1</font><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk"> Postulating a labor theory of ownership,
he held that the only way property can come into being is by someone
expending labor in making it. Moreover, since land as he thought of
it was limited in extent and yet was the source of men&#39;s subsistence,
for anyone to claim absolute ownership over it would be immoral; for
in theory, at least, the landed class might then deprive others of their
very subsistence by excluding them from land when there was no place
else to go. One should only claim the usufruct of land, therefore, and
then only so far as there remains &quot;as much and as good&quot; for
others. This becomes problematic, however, the moment someone claims
scarcity. Locke suggested no solution to this. Presumably, it would
be up to legislatures and courts to determine the fairness of individual
land holdings and reassign them accordingly.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Influenced
by Locke&#39;s labor theory and his moralizing bent, later writers, notably
Karl Marx and Henry George, concluded that property in land was a usurpation,
not a part of the order of nature, but an artificial monopoly enforced
by the state for the benefit of the landed interests. Marx made the
abolition of property in land the first plank of the Communist Manifesto
of 1848, and George wrote a monumental work, PROGRESS AND POVERTY, arguing
for nationalizing property in land or making it the sole subject of
taxation. The &quot;land question&quot; was hotly debated toward the
end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. But
the protagonists on both sides, unable to make headway in their arguments,
gradually bogged down, and the subject of land has been largely ignored
in economic literature since that time.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Spencer
Heath in the mid-20th century suggested, as an alternative to Locke&#39;s
labor theory, a different and perhaps more productive way of conceiving
of property in general. He looked upon property not normatively or judgmentally,
but descriptively, as anything that can be the subject matter of contract.
This enabled him to describe for the first time the social function
of property in land. While his conclusions hold for land ownership in
pre-industrial society, they have particular relevance for an advanced
market economy.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk"><b>Social
Role of Property in Land</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Ownership
is a social consensus that has little or nothing to do with legislated
law, as evidenced by the elaborate development of systems of property
in stateless societies. Owning things enables those things to be bought
and sold and traded, and hence a free market to develop. The virtue
of a free market in land is that in an advanced society it enables people
to move about freely, positioning their own specialized activities to
best advantage relative to those of other people. Thus, property rights
in land can be understood as positioning rights, and the buying and
selling of land as the buying and selling of positioning rights with
respect to the increasingly specialized location uses of others. Without
freedom to barter and sell positioning rights with respect to one another
in society, mobility and tenure would be precarious, subject to vicissitudes
of force or favor. The choice between not having a free market and having
one is the choice between <i>politics versus proprietorship</i>, the
title chosen by Spencer Heath for his first collection of essays on
the subject in 1936.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Heath
went on further to describe how land, privately owned, is increasingly
administered in an advanced economy as productive capital. He was fond
of defining capital in a way that highlights its function in the free-market
process. Capital, he said, is any wealth in a market economy that is
dedicated, directly or indirectly, to the use of others. Thus, Robinson
Crusoe, as long as he was alone on the island, had no capital and never
would, for there was no exchange system. He had tools, but these were
not capital because they were serving only himself. Heath used the illustration
of the tobacconist: his cigars on display are capital, but when he takes
one out and puts it in his vest pocket intending to smoke it at lunch,
that one is no longer capital. Deciding not to smoke it after all and
putting it back in the display case, it becomes capital again. Any land
owner who, instead of using a site for himself for a residence, say,
or a subsistence farm, lets its use out to others, enters into the contractual,
free-market process by administering that property as capital. As this
becomes common practice in an advanced, free-market economy, it has
some unexpected and altogether intriguing social implications.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk"><b>The Manufacture
and Marketing of Environment</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">An
owner who lets or sells anything to another naturally wants it to be
serviceable for his customer so that his customer will be able to serve
him in turn. More than that, if he is entrepreneurial, he looks for
ways to improve it. In the case of land, if he has let out its use to
another, how can he do that? He can only improve a location in that
case by tailoring its environment to his customer&#39;s needs. Thus, a land
owner, who wants to improve the worth of a piece of land he has leased
out, puts his attention not on the land itself, but inevitably on its <i>
environment</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">By
way of illustration, the owner of a shopping mall customizes the individual
locations in the mall by a complex orchestration of the whole. He is
alert to everything in the mall that is environmentally significant
for the individual leased sites. Beyond providing adequate parking and
attractive landscaping, he studies the placement of stores and common
areas/facilities for their optimal effect on each merchant&#39;s economic
location. He strives for an optimal selection of merchants to create
the maximum draw from the market area collectively served by the merchants.
He wants, moreover, for every merchant to find himself part of a vibrant
community of merchants who together make an effective retailing team,
each ready to cooperate in a hundred different ways such as participating
in joint promotions, referring customers, maintaining a good appearance,
keeping regular hours, or alerting one another promptly in security
matters. Every team needs a coach, and he can fill that role. Because
the merchants recognize that he is not partisan but is interested in
the success of the whole mall, as such, the mall manager is in a position
to provide effective leadership as the final environmental feature--the
catalyst--that helps all of this to happen. All of this results from
the owner administering economic location as productive capital by putting
it to the service of others.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">But
as the environment of the leased sites is blind to property lines and
continues ever outward, so the mall owner&#39;s environmental concern extends
well beyond the bounds of the mall. He wants all of the more obvious
things in the surrounding community that affect the merchants collectively,
such as convenient freeways and other transportation to and from the
market area they serve. But more than that, the owner wants the surrounding
community to be affluent, since that means a prosperous customer base
for his merchants. The level of affluence in the host community is determined
by many of the same things that give leased sites within the mall their
utility, such as provision and maintenance of parks and well-placed
streets, water and power and other utilities, sewerage, security, justice
services, to name a few. The owner, therefore, is concerned with the
quality of management in the surrounding community, as he is within
the mall itself, which is to say that he is interested in the quality
of local government. He is concerned that municipal services be performed
and performed well and with minimal tax consequences for the community,
whether that means monitoring, informally supervising, subsidizing,
or actually providing the services, alone or in collaboration with other
owners. Although attenuated with increasing distance, his non-partisan
interest in sound public administration extends beyond the host community
to the county, the state, and the nation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">This
illustration had to do with an owner leasing out to multiple tenants.
A small landlord, leasing or renting to perhaps one tenant, has little
hope of improving or rearranging the environment of that small parcel
to make it more valuable to the tenant. He is almost as helpless as
an individual owner who uses the land directly. He lets it for whatever
use and level of use the existing surroundings permit and has little
control over how community infrastructure is provided. If he looks for
any improvement at all, it is for municipal government to intervene
on his behalf. But as he enlarges his holding or combines with others
to achieve a holding of more practical size, and acquires multiple tenants,
he gains leverage over the environment. He finds that in the very act
of leasing to multiple tenants, each becomes a factor in the environment
of every other, with a consequent potential for synergy. By careful
selection, therefore, he strives to optimize his tenant mix. As his
customer base increases, it becomes economically attractive for him
to make other and more substantial investments of an environmental nature.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">The
development of multi-tenant income properties since only the mid-eighteenth
century is one of the lesser known yet more dramatic stories in American
land usage. In the last fifty years, more than half of the retail activity
of the nation has shifted to shopping centers, and everywhere else,
multi-tenant income properties have proliferated both in number and
in kind. The major types, listed here roughly in the order of their
appearance, include hotels, apartment buildings, office buildings (&quot;skyscrapers&quot;),
commercial airports, shopping centers, RV parks and camp grounds, mobile-home
parks, marinas, science parks, professional parks, medical clinics,
theme parks, and integrations and combinations of these into generalized,
multi-use developments. Some hotels today, such as the MGM Grand or
the Venetian in Las Vegas, have the complexity of a small city. A resident
could fulfill any or all of his normal needs without ever leaving the
property. As to size, both of the hotels named far surpass in population
the city of Boston at the time of our War for Independence.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Thus
in terms of increasing complexity and size, we can discern a historic
trend of multi-tenant income properties moving at least in the direction
of becoming what we are accustomed to think of as communities, albeit
communities that are privately funded and administered through the free-market
process.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Those
influenced by the old view and by Locke&#39;s labor theory of ownership
hold that a &quot;land owner&quot; can be such in name only. He cannot
own land because he can&#39;t create it, land being pre-existent. Since
he doesn&#39;t create land, they don&#39;t see that he performs any service.
Not performing any service, he is not entitled to any recompense such
as sales price or rent. Their view does not take into account the service
that all owners, including owners of land, perform and for which they
are recompensed in the market. Even the small land owner who is unable
to do more than passively let or sell a location &quot;as is,&quot;
without improving it, nevertheless performs a service deserving of its
recompense.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">The
fundamental service performed by an owner of land or any other good
is of two kinds. First is the stand-by service of holding clear, unchallenged
title, which benefits all of society. For this he receives no recompense
from any other party except that all members of the cooperating group
respect his sole authority over the thing in question, as he does their
authority over the things they own. Thus, they grant one another what
is known in the old common-law language as &quot;quiet possession,&quot;
&quot;quiet&quot; here meaning that others will respect it. This enables
people to hold and productively use resources in society. Second is
the service that an owner performs when he enters into the exchange
system and transfers that quiet possession to another, and for this
social/psychological (non-physical) service he appropriately receives
a recompense. When such transfer takes place, both parties to the transaction
profit and are recompensed according to how they value their property
and what they receive in exchange. This transfer of ownership or title--this
transfer of quiet possession--is a service <i>only owners can perform</i>,
and it is the sine-qua-non of civilization. The convention of ownership
and exchange is the customary and nonpolitical means, the peaceable
means by which people hold and distribute resources in society.</font><font size="1" face="New Century Schlbk">2</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">Environmental
enterprise--the administration of land as productive capital--is relatively
new in the world. It signifies a new direction in the continuing evolution
of the free market toward providing not only individual goods and services,
which it has given us in great abundance, but community and environmental
services, which traditionally have been the province of political government.
Projected into the future, this suggests that nature&#39;s plan, as it were,
for human society is that it shall be stateless--that is to say, consistent
throughout, without any institutionalized contravention of property
rights. This is broadly the pattern in which human society began: the
headman of a local group or clan had influence, but no authority over
the person or property of any other. The difficult period of transition
from social cooperation in small groups based on kinship status to universal
cooperation based on contract has been marked by upheavals and disturbances
manifested repeatedly in massive predations by political governments.
That period of transition is far from complete and its success far from
assured, considering the technological resources now in the hands of
the political rulers of the world. But there is light at the end of
the tunnel, or so it would seem, and not that far off, if we can survive
to reach it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3" face="New Century Schlbk">[Spencer
H. MacCallum is author of numerous articles and books of interest to
voluntaryists. See his THE ART OF COMMUNITY (1970), and THE LAW OF THE
SOMALIS (editor, 2005). He may be reached at sm@look.net.]</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="1" face="New Century Schlbk"><sub>1</sub></font><font size="2" face="New Century Schlbk"> It seems odd that Locke nevertheless
does continue to use the term &quot;property&quot; with reference to
land. For example, he wrote in TWO TREATISES OF GOVERNMENT (Second Treatise,
Section 32, in Chapter 5), &quot;</font><font size="2" face="New Century Schlbk"><i>As
much Land</i> as Man Tills, Plants, Improves, Cultivates and can use
the Product of, so much is his <i>Property</i>.&quot; But then it would
follow that, according to Locke, should a man cease to till, plant,
improve, cultivate, and use the product of land, it would cease to be
his property. This is not consonant with the most ordinary usage of
the term &quot;property,&quot; which denotes things that one can leave
alone for long periods of time, if not indefinitely, without having
them revert to the public domain. Property can be let to others with
its time or use delimited, and that tenure is no less considered property,
subject to its agreed-upon limitations. But the reversionary interest
normally continues without limit as to time or the use one makes of
it, so long, of course, as that use is not destructive of the similar
rights of others.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="1" face="New Century Schlbk"><sub>2</sub></font><font size="2" face="New Century Schlbk"> Note that speculation in land or
any other kind of property can be beneficial, though risky. In an exchange
system, an owner receives recompense only as he puts his property to
the use of others, for market value arises only at the point of exchange,
all other value being anticipatory or wishful. Holding property in anticipation
of a greater value later can benefit the entire cooperating group--society--by
preventing wasteful or premature use of scarce resources. But he who
wrongly anticipates the future may receive less than he offered his
property for initially. Only he who correctly anticipates society&#39;s
future needs will find himself in a position to do more of the same.</font></p>
