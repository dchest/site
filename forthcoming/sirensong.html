<h2>The Siren Song of the State</h2>

The state is the most destructive institution human beings have ever devised - a fire that, at best, can be controlled
for only a short time before it o'erleaps its improvised confinements and spreads its flames far and wide.
<br><br>
     Whatever promotes the growth of the state also weakens the capacity of individuals in civil society to fend off the
state's depredations and therefore augments the public's multifaceted victimization at the hands of state functionaries.
Nothing promotes the growth of the state as much as national emergency - war and other crises comparable to war in the
seriousness of the threats they pose.
<br><br>
     States, by their very nature, are perpetually at war - not always against foreign foes, of course, but always
against their own subjects. The state's most fundamental purpose, the activity without which it cannot even exist,
is robbery. The state gains its very sustenance from robbery, which it pretties up ideologically by giving it a
different name (taxation) and by striving to sanctify its intrinsic crime as permissible and socially necessary.
State propaganda, statist ideologies, and long-established routine combine to convince many people that they have a
legitimate obligation, even a moral duty to pay taxes to the state that rules their society.
<br><br>
     They fall into such erroneous moral reasoning because they are told incessantly that the tribute they fork over
is actually a kind of price paid for essential services received, and that in the case of certain services, such as
protection from foreign and domestic aggressors against their rights to life, liberty, and property, only the government
can provide the service effectively. They are not permitted to test this claim by resorting to competing suppliers of law,
 order, and security, however, because the government enforces a monopoly over the production and distribution of its
alleged "services" and brings violence to bear against would-be competitors. In so doing, it reveals the fraud at the
heart of its impudent claims and gives sufficient proof that it is not a genuine protector, but a mere protection racket.
