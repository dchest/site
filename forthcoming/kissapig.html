<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> By Carl Watner</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">
In recent years, there have been countless words exchanged between free
market anarchists and limited government minarchists concerning such
questions as </font></p>
<ul><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1. Must every human society
have a government?</font></p></ul>
<ul><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">2. Is government necessarily
coercive?</font></p></ul>
<ul><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">3. Can government be financed
voluntarily (i.e., without coercion)?</font></p></ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Debates over these questions
have been going on for well over a hundred years and include such authors
as Charles Lane (A VOLUNTARY POLITICAL GOVERNMENT, [1843]), Herbert
Spencer (“On the Proper Sphere of Government” [1842/1843] and “The
Right to Ignore the State” [1850]), Benjamin Tucker (INSTEAD OF A
BOOK [1897]), and Auberon Herbert (TAXATION AND ANARCHISM: A Discussion
Between the Hon. Auberon Herbert and J. H. Levy [1912]). Although I
am familiar with these authors, and have written about some of them
(my Introduction to Lane&#39;s book [1982], and  my overview of &quot;The
English Individualists as They Appear in LIBERTY&quot; [1985]), the article
you are now reading was originally sparked by a December 20, 2009
interview with Dr. Tibor Machan in which he stated:</font></p>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rothbard said governments
are necessarily coercive and I disagree; he thought government must
be a coercive monopoly and I disagree. ... I&#39;m a principled minarchist
like Rand. ... I am convinced that minarchism can avoid all coercion
and Rothbard was wrong claiming otherwise. ... If all citizens select
a group of them to administer the just laws of the land, coercion is
absent. [1] </font></p></blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Machan then adds a parenthetic
note to see his essay, &quot;Reconciling Anarchism and Minarchism,&quot;
in ANARCHISM/MINARCHISM: Is a Government Part of a Free Country? (2008),
the book he co-edited with Roderick T. Long. Of course, Dr. Machan has
a long list of contributions he has made to this controversy, including
his discussion of &quot;The Anarchist Thesis&quot; in HUMAN RIGHTS AND
HUMAN LIBERTIES (1975); &quot;Financing Government without Coercive
Measures&quot; in THE LIBERTARIAN READER (1982); and &quot;Defining
Government, Begging the Question: An Answer to Walter Block&#39;s Reply&quot;
in JOURNAL OF LIBERTARIAN STUDIES (Spring 2007).</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Undoubtedly
many readers are familiar with the general principle of logic behind
Occam&#39;s razor or its popularized version, Keep It Simple, Stupid! Referred
to as the &quot;Law of Economy, or Law of Parsimony&quot; it points
out that entities and questions &quot;are not to be multiplied beyond
necessity.&quot; So to cut to the quick and cut through the thousands
of words of controversy, generated by anarchists and minarchists alike,
I would like some minarchist to answer the following question:</font></p>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What would their
defense service organization do if it could not attract enough
voluntary customers? </font></p></blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If the minarchist acknowledges
that his limited government organization would go bankrupt or disappear,
then the discussion is ended, and the anarchist argument prevails. For
if the government&#39;s response to a loss of customers is to go out of
business (like every other business that loses patronage and cannot
sustain itself financially), then it is clear that such a government
has no coercive monopoly on the administration of justice and protection
of property within the area in which it operates. Other defense agencies
may arrive to take its place, and there is nothing the bankrupt defense
agency can do about it, since it is no longer in existence. In short,
as Gustave de Molinari described it in 1849, there would be a free market
in &quot;the production of security.&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     This
is nearly the exact question I presented to Dr. Machan in an email of
February 21, 2010:</font> <br></p>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">What happens to
a minarchist government if its citizens for whatever reason withdraw
their financial support and boycott it? </font> <br></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Such reasons might
reflect the fact that they have all become pacifists, or that they all
have decided to choose personal self-defense in lieu of minarchist protection,
or that they have decided to choose another agency to provide them with
protection.</font> <br></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">In other words,
what happens to a limited government organization if its citizen/customers
choose not to patronize it? Will it go bankrupt? Will it disappear -
if not, by what means will it survive?</font> <br></p></blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">To which Dr. Machan replied:</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">
&quot;Such a country would vanish, as any other establishment lacking
support would.&quot;</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Enough said!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     There
are two other comments worth making. First, in the last line of the
quoted interview, Dr. Machan pointed out that &quot;If all citizens
select a group of them to administer the just laws of the land, coercion
is absent.&quot; True enough, if there is unanimous consent and every
&quot;citizen&quot; has a voluntary contract with the service provider.
John Hospers made this same point in a written debate with Murray Rothbard
in 1973. Here is how Rothbard responded:</font></p>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Dr. Hospers maintains
that if one private agency should &quot;predominate in a certain area,
it would in effect be the government. ... [T]here would be very little
difference&quot; between that and a single government agency of protection.
... It must be pointed out that even in these conditions, it makes a
great deal of difference, because (a) individuals can always have the
right to call in another, competing defense agency, and (b) the private
agency would acquire its income from voluntary purchases of satisfied
customers, rather than from the robbery of taxation. In short, the difference
between a free society and a society with built-in legalized aggression.
Between anarchism and archy. [2]</font> <br></p></blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     The
second comment regards the answers to the three questions with which
I opened this article. In order to do so, it is necessary to define
&quot;government&quot; and distinguish its essential characteristics
from other types of defense service organizations. In his article on
&quot;Defining Government,&quot; Dr. Machan makes the following comments.</font> <br>
</p>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;The gist
of my case is that the anarchists&#39; defense-insurance agencies or justice
services are a version of noncoercive governments.&quot; [p. 91]</font> <br>
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Why are we
to accept that the concept &#39;government&#39; necessarily implies coercion
(e.g. taxation)? The fact that most governments have been coercive is
no more of a defense of this position than it would be to claim that
the concept &#39;marriage&#39; necessarily implies adultery because most marriages
throughout human history have involved adultery ... . [p. 92]</font> <br>
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Some ...
libertarians chose to retain the term &#39;government&#39; for the institution
that would maintain law and order in society; others came up with new
terms such as &#39;defense-insurance agency.&#39; But both meant the same thing,
namely, legal authorities who would proceed to establish, maintain,
and uphold justice via a legal order without ever officially using coercive
force.&quot; [p. 92]</font> <br></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Defense-insurance
agencies are governments of a certain type.&quot; [p. 94]</font> <br>
</p></blockquote>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Apparently, Dr. Machan views
government as a broad class of institutions that maintain law and order
in society, and which can be either coercive or voluntary. Although
I have not seen him use the terminology, he might describe the coercive
versions of government as &quot;political governments&quot; and the
non-coercive versions as &quot;voluntary governments.&quot; He clearly
rejects political government because it is coercive, and supports only
voluntary government. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     But
how, we ask, are we to distinguish voluntary governments from all other
voluntary institutions and non-coercive organizations in society? There
are many, such as the family, the church, the various businesses we
patronize, the various clubs we belong to, various associations, such
as the Red Cross, the American Baseball League, etc., etc., all of which
contribute to the maintenance of law and order. Every legitimate property
owner and every peaceful person in society help maintain law and order
by their exercise of self-control (not violating other people&#39;s bodies
or other people&#39;s property). The spontaneous, free interaction among
peaceful people is the only true form of law and order that is possible.
Political governments can only produce &quot;political&quot; law. As
John Hasnas explains in his &quot;The Myth of the Rule of Law,&quot;
coercive governments purposefully associate &quot;law&quot; with &quot;order&quot;
as a way to deliberately obfuscate the fact that a voluntary social
order can be had without the presence of a political government. As
John Blundell and Colin Robinson write in REGULATION WITHOUT THE STATE
(2000), &quot;Rules are an essential part of life. But making them is
not necessarily a [political] government function: they can be (and
usually are) established through voluntary action.&quot; The so-called
law and order fashioned by political governments is not really true
law or true order because it is not based on the voluntary interaction
and the voluntary consent of the participants. Furthermore, whatever
legitimate contribution  political governments make to the voluntary
social order could be provided in a far less costly and far more moral
manner by private defense agencies. In short, just as we need food,
shelter, and clothing, we need rules for peacefully interacting with
others; but it is no more necessary that political government provide
us with food, shelter, and clothing, than it provide us with the rules
and regulations for peaceful interaction with our fellow man. Political
government not only negates property rights, but rents asunder the peaceful
fabric of society.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     Finally,
Dr. Machan asks &quot;Why are we to accept that the concept &#39;government&#39;
necessarily implies coercion (e.g., taxation)?&quot; In reply, let us
quote Ayn Rand who asks: &quot;Who has the final authority in ethics?
... Who &#39;decided&#39; what is the right way to make an automobile ... ?
Any man who cares to acquire the appropriate knowledge and to judge,
at and for his own risk and sake.&quot; By Dr. Machan&#39;s own admission
&quot;most governments have been coercive.&quot; Governments have been
construed as coercive institutions because that is the way their representatives
and leaders have acted historically; because that is the way they behave
today; and because there is no better way to view the difference between
criminal institutions and voluntary ones than to identify those as governments
which exercise coercive power. A government which resorts to no coercion
is not a government because it is a voluntary organization claiming
no special powers of obedience. To describe some governments as non-coercive
is like painting the word &#39;dog&#39; on the side of a pig, and then calling
the pig a &#39;dog.&#39; A pig is still a pig regardless of what you call it
or how many times you kiss it or how many times you bathe it. It&#39;s the
same with governments. As long as they continue to imprison people and/or
confiscate the property of those who refuse to pay their taxes, they
are coercive. Only when they stop doing these things and allow competition
in the production of security will they have exchanged their essential
coercive features for voluntary ones.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;In the real world, there
is never any difficulty identifying a voluntary-funded firm and a coercive,
tax-funded government agency. You simply look at how the organization
obtains its funding - if the funding comes from voluntary payments,
it is a firm or charity, while if the funding comes from sticking a
gun to men&#39;s heads, it is a government agency or a criminal gang.&quot;</font></p>
