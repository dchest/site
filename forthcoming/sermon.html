<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> By Larken Rose</font> <br>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     We read now from the Gospel
according to Government, first book of Politicians, Chapter 1, Verse
1.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     In the beginning, there
was chaos and mayhem, and people were as wild beasts. And there was
great wailing, and gnashing of teeth throughout the land. Then it came
to pass that politicians came down out of heaven, shining in glory,
and spoke unto the people, saying, &quot;Were are the Lord thy government,
and we have decided to bless you with our presence, so that we may save
you from your sins. Obey our commands, pay tribute unto us, and salvation
shall be yours. For you are but stupid, violent animals, and only through
our benevolent domination of you shall you be transformed into a civilized,
happy and prosperous people.&quot;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     And the people wondered
at the words of the politicians, and were sorely afraid. But the politicians
said unto them, &quot;Fear not. If you blindly obey the god called government,
and mindlessly follow our every whim, then you shall be blessed. But
those who would disobey our commands--the heathens and criminals who
think for themselves--being evil in our sight, shall be cast into prison,
and banished from the collectivist paradise we shall create for you.
Cast aside your individual judgment, your free will, your conscience
and your moral codes, and follow us, the high priests of government,
without thought or question. &quot;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     &quot;The foolish man builds
his house upon consensus, cooperation, and voluntary interaction, but
the wise man builds his house upon political promises, state coercion,
and the lust for power over others. Free will, self-determination, and
peaceful coexistence are the devil&#39;s work, and lead only to fire and
brimstone, suffering and torment. But blind obedience, unthinking loyalty,
and unwavering subservience are the path to salvation.&quot;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     &quot;You have heard that
it hath been said, love your neighbor, and do unto others as you would
have done unto you. But we, the politicians, say unto you, pray for
the incarceration or extermination of those who are not like you. But
pray also for your neighbors to be taxed and regulated, petition for
your friends to be controlled and enslaved, devote your heart and soul
to the rituals of the cult of politics, so that we, the high priests
of government, may dominate all of mankind, for its own good. Only then
shall you have everlasting peace.&quot;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     &quot;We are the lord thy
government, and here are our commandments. Thou shalt have no other
gods before government. Thou shalt follow no moral codes and no value
systems above the arbitrary whims of your masters. Thou shalt not take
the name of government in vain, or speak against us, the high priests
of state. For those who do so are sinners, criminals and terrorists
in our eyes, and shall be wiped from the face of the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     &quot;Remember election
day, to keep it holy. Judge not the politicians, lest ye be put on the
no-fly list. Honor thy congressman and thy senator, that their reign
may be long upon the land which government thy god has taken from thee.&quot;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     &quot;Thou shalt murder,
by voting for those who engage in perpetual war-mongering. Thou shalt
kill, when government commands it. And the killing shall be called,
&quot;national defense,&quot; &quot;serving one&#39;s country,&quot; and
&quot;spreading democracy.&quot; No greater love hath a man than this,
that a man will go halfway around the world to murder complete strangers,
because we told him to.&quot;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     &quot;Thou shalt steal,
by voting for your neighbors to be taxed, and thou shalt hate and persecute
any who resist. Thou shalt covet thy neighbor&#39;s income, and his house,
and everything that is thy neighbor&#39;s, and beg the lord thy government
to take these things from thy neighbor, to give them unto thee. Verily
we say unto you, it is greedy and selfish to keep what you have earned,
but noble and virtuous to take what your neighbor has earned.&quot;</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     &quot;Thou shalt bear false
witness, by calling thieves and robbers &quot;public servants,&quot;
by calling usurpers and tyrants &quot;representatives,&quot; and by
calling those who advocate liberty for all, &quot;criminals and terrorists.&quot; </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">Blessed are the blindly obedient, for the politicians
shall reward them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after power,
for they shall be satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">Blessed are the voters, for they shall legitimize
tyranny and oppression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">Blessed are the bankers, for they shall embezzle
the earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">Blessed are the jackbooted thugs, for they shall
get away with murder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">Blessed are the corrupt in heart, for they shall
receive power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">Blessed are the war-mongers, for they shall imagine
themselves to be gods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">Blessed are they who have persecuted the innocent,
for the politicians&#39; sakes, for they shall be promoted.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     And cursed are the heathens
and extremists, who speak out against our tyranny, who encourage you
to question authority, and who instruct you to disobey immoral commands. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     We, the politicians, say
unto you, worship those who insult and exploit you, bow to those who
extort and oppress you, and vote for those who spitefully use you
and persecute you.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:&#39;Helvetica&#39;,&#39;Arial&#39;;font-size:12pt">     Here ends our reading from
the first book of politicians, from the gospel according to government.</span></p>
