1) Should the Federal Reserve System be abolished?
<br><br>
2) If so, what monetary system should take its place?
<br><br>
     My answers to these questions are:
<br>
 (1) No, the Federal Reserve System should not be abolished. If some
 people want to continue to use Federal Reserve notes as money they should
 be able to do so. However, they should not be able to impose their choice
 on others.
<br><br>
 and
<br><br>
 (2) The only monetary system to take the place of Federal Reserve notes,
 if they were to fall into disuse, should be a voluntary one; a monetary
 system in which people freely choose what they use for money.
<br><br>
 These may seem surprising and even contradictory responses, so please
 read on to understand my reasons for answering this way.
<br><br>
Money is a commodity people use to facilitate their exchanges with
 other people. Economists refer to money as a commonly used medium of
 exchange. For long periods of history, money has usually been characterized
 by having a large value relative to its bulk and weight; by being
 homogeneous (one part being just like every other part); by being easily
 divisible into smaller parts (with each smaller unit retaining its
 proportional value to the whole); by being durable (not easily destroyed);
 and by generally maintaining its exchange value relative to other desirable
 things.
<br><br>
In a free society, the production of money would be a matter left to
 private enterprise. Money producers would compete with one another to offer
 the best product at the lowest cost. Such a system would be devoid of State
 coercion and government interference. The law of natural displacement (the
 best money will be used by traders and will displace less suitable ones)
 would minimize useless innovations because people would only accept new
 forms of money if they saw value in the improvements offered. Monetary
 freedom means that whatever is chosen for money must be able to survive on
 its own merits. A money that people must be forced to use has already lost
 its credibility. If the money the government wants people to use and accept
 had any inherent advantages over other monies, then there would be no
 reason to pass laws that force them to use it.
<br><br>
Just as there is more than one kind of credit card and payment
 system, e.g., Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, etc., there could be more than one
 kind of money, each touting its advantages to the end user. No one can tell
 in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for
 sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be
 discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money
 have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage. There is no way to
 determine the advances that might have occurred due to the government’s
 discouragement of competition. Just imagine if Congress had protected the
 Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from
 communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels
 of e-mail. What we do know, however, is that ever since the Civil War
 between the States, the federal government has successfully prosecuted
 competing providers of money. As recently as 2011, the principal of NORFED,
 the National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve, was
 convicted of violating the provisions of 18 United States Code, Sections 2,
 371, 485, 486 and 1341, which prohibit the creation of “private coin or
 currency systems [designed] to compete with the official coinage and
 currency of the United States” government. At the conclusion of the trial,
 the United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, Anne
 T. Tompkins, issued a press release (March 18, 2011), reiterating the
 government’s harsh attitude in suppressing potential competition:
 Attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are
 simply a unique form of domestic terrorism. While these forms of
 anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as
 insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic
 stability of this country.
<br><br>
     Despite the government’s claims to the contrary, it is not necessary
 that money be provided by government or that there be only one monetary
 system in place. Gold and silver were commonly used media of exchange for
 centuries. No person or institution has the right to prevent people from
 using their property and exchanging it in a peaceful manner. The history of
 private gold coinage in the United States shows what happened when the
 government was not there to force people to trade with a certain type of
 money. It was a natural right of the miner to pan or dig for gold. He could
 coin whatever precious metals he found so long as he did not counterfeit or
 imitate the coin of the United States government. Congress, at the time,
 did not believe it had the power to prohibit him from weighing and assaying
 his pieces of gold, marking upon them their weight and fineness, and
 exchanging them for whatever other people were willing to give for them. In
 Rutherfordton, North Carolina members of the Bechtler family coined over $
 2 million of gold between 1831 and 1840; in Denver, Colorado the Clark &
 Gruber mint produced over $ 500,000 of gold coins between 1859 and 1863,
 and in California immediately after the 1849 Gold Rush there were numerous
 private issues of coin and ingots. During this time, the common law right
 of the private coiner to issue gold coins was fully recognized by both the
 public which used them and the government that tolerated them.
<br><br>
     When exchanges take place they are either voluntary or coerced. No
 voluntary exchange takes place unless both parties expect to better
 themselves. When people are forced to trade, it is obvious that their best
 interests (as they define them) are not being served. Coerced exchanges
 only benefit one party at the expense of the other. This, in fact, is just
 what happens when people are forced to use Federal Reserve notes in their
 daily transactions. But because they are so accustomed to this form of
 government intervention in their lives, very few people recognize the
 government’s threat of violence or the economic disutility arising from the
 use of force. Political controls and struggles over money and credit have
 continually disrupted our society from its very inception and have made
 economic calculation increasingly difficult.  As Gustav Stolper pointed out
 in his 1942 book, THIS AGE OF FABLE, “A ‘free’ capitalism with government
 responsibility for money and credit has lost its innocence. From that point
 on it is no longer a matter of principle but one of expediency how far one
 wishes or permits governmental interference to go. Money control is the
 supreme and most comprehensive of all governmental controls short of
 expropriation.”
<br><br>
     Now all this has been offered by way of showing why we should not
 have a governmental system of money. But why argue that the Federal Reserve
 System should not be abolished? Because if a voluntary monetary system is
 to be achieved it must be brought about in a peaceful, voluntary way. If
 most people are wedded to a money produced and operated by a
 quasi-government institution with powers to enforce coercive legal tender
 laws and a government monopoly over the production of money, then to
 “demolish, destroy, or put an end” to that system against their wishes
 would only result in the erection of another similar system in its place. A
 voluntary money system cannot be forced upon people. It must come about
 naturally, over time, as the result of millions of freely-made individual
 choices and exchanges.
<br><br>
     The Federal Reserve System will only be replaced permanently if
 people come to understand the morality and practicality of a voluntary
 system. When a sufficient number of them recognize its merits, then instead
 of abolishing the Federal Reserve System, they will simply abandon it in
 favor of using better money. At that point, laws supporting the Federal
 Reserve would be rendered ineffective by people’s refusal to obey them. In
 such a situation, it would become nearly impossible for the government to
 prosecute, convict, and imprison all those who refuse to handle Federal
 Reserve notes.
<br><br>
     Not only is it inconsistent to force men to be free, but people who
 have been forced to be free do not understand why they should accept
 personal responsibility for their own lives. Button-pushing (as in pushing
 the button to abolish the Federal Reserve System) would probably result in
 chaos because most people would still be looking to government to produce
 the money they use. To abolish is to resort to compulsion, and the free man
 does not force others to be free. The free man controls himself. He decides
 what he shall use for money. He recognizes the right of others to choose
 how they will live. This includes their freedom to choose what they will
 use for money.
